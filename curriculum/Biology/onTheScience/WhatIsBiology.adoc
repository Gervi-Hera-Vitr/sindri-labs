== The characteristics of life

All living things share eight (8) characteristics::

. Made of cells (unicellular or multicellular);
. Reproduce (asexual or sexual);
. Based on a universal genetic code (DNA);
. Grow and develop;
. Obtain and use energy (metabolism);
. Respond to stimuli (environmental response);
. Maintain a stable internal environment (homeostasis);
. Evolve as a group over time (evolution).

== The levels of life

From smallest to largest::
- Atom
- Molecule
- Organelle
- Cell
- Tissue
- Organ
- Organ system
- Organism
- Population
- Community
- Ecosystem
- Biosphere
- Universe
