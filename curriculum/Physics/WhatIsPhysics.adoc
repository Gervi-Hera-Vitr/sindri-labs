*_Physics is the study of matter, energy, and how they interact._*

It explains the fundamental laws of nature that govern motion, forces, energy, and the structure of matter.

It answers::
- Why things move.
- How energy is transferred.
- How the universe works at every scale.

== Why Study Physics?

- Physics is *_the foundation_* of other sciences like chemistry, biology, and astronomy.
- It helps in developing technology, from smartphones to rockets.
- It improves problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

== Branches of Physics

- *Mechanics*: Motion, forces, energy (Newton's Laws).
- *Thermodynamics*: Heat, temperature, and energy transfer.
- *Waves and Sound*: Vibrations, sound, and wave behavior.
- *Optics*: Light, lenses, mirrors, reflection/refraction.
- *Electricity and Magnetism*: Circuits, electric fields, magnets.
- *Modern Physics*: Quantum physics, relativity, atomic theory.

== The Scientific Method in Physics

Physics relies on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method[The Scientific Method], which includes::

. Observation
. Question
. Hypothesis
. Experiment
. Data Collection
. Analysis
. Conclusion

== Physical Quantities and Units

_Physics uses measurements to describe and predict phenomena._

_Base Quantities_::
* Length - meters *m*.
* Mass - kilograms *kg*.
* Time - seconds *s*.
* Temperature - kelvin *K*.
* Electric current - amperes *A*.
* Electric charge - coulombs *C*.
* Electric potential - volts *V*.

== SI Units (International System of Units)

*_The SI system is the standard for measurements._*

Example::
* Distance = meters (m)
* Mass = kilograms (kg)
* Time = seconds (s)
* Force = newtons (N) (Derived unit)

== Scalars vs. Vectors
* *Scalar*: Quantity with magnitude-only (size)
** _Example_: Speed = 60 km/h
* *Vector*: Quantity with magnitude and direction
** _Example_: Velocity = 60 km/h north

== Measurement and Instruments

* Length ‚Üí Ruler, Vernier Caliper, Micrometer
* Mass ‚Üí Balance
* Time ‚Üí Stopwatch
* Temperature ‚Üí Thermometer
* Electric Current ‚Üí Ammeter

== 1.9 Accuracy, Precision, and Errors

* *Accuracy*: How close a measurement is to the true value.
* *Precision*: How consistent repeated measurements are.

* _Error types_:
** Systematic error: Consistent, repeatable error.
** Random error: Unpredictable variations in measurements.

== Graphs and Data Representation

* *Line Graphs*: Show changes over time or relationships.
* *Bar Graphs*: Compare quantities.
* *Pie Charts*: Show parts of a whole.

== Basic Mathematical Skills for Physics

* Algebra (solving equations)
* Ratios and Proportions
* Graphs and Slopes (understanding relationships)
* Trigonometry (basic sine, cosine, tangent)

*_Physics is a science derived from mathematics just like every other science._*
