== Marcus Aurelius (April 26, 121 AD – March 17, 180 AD)

Marcus Aurelius was a Roman emperor and philosopher, best known for being a leading figure of Stoic philosophy. He ruled as emperor from 161 to 180 AD, and his reign is often remembered as the last phase of the *Pax Romana* — a long period of relative peace and stability across the Roman Empire.

He is widely considered to be one of the most intelligent Roman emperors and is the author of *Meditations*, a collection of philosophical Stoic teachings.

Marcus emphasized virtues such as self-control, rationality, duty, and endurance in the face of hardship. He believed in accepting fate and maintaining inner peace regardless of external circumstances.
