Around 66 million years ago, shortly after the extinction of the dinosaurs, the first primates emerged.
And these primates, 10s of Millions of years later, would evolve into humans: The Dominate Species of earth.
This is their journey.

== The First Primates

What Were They?::

These early ancestors are known as {proto-primates}[Proto-Primates]. They were small, arboreal (tree-dwelling) mammals that lived in the forests of what is now North America and Europe.

The Connection::

Proto-primates were considered a midway point between modern primates and rodents.
They had long bodies with tails, claws instead of nails, and their eyes were positioned on the sides of their heads, giving them limited depth perception.
They were nocturnal, relying more on their sense of smell than sight, and had small brains compared to later primates.


=== {purgeatorius}[Purgatorius]

- _Lived around 66 million years ago, shortly after the dinosaurs went extinct._
- Considered one of the earliest proto-primate species.
- Tiny, about the size of a modern rat.
- Lived in trees, likely feeding on fruit and insects.
- It Represented an early stage in primate evolution, although it still had many rodent-like features.

=== {plesiadapis}[Plesiadapis]

- _Lived around 58 million years ago._
- More advanced than *Purgatorius*, but still not quite a true primate.
- Lacked grasping hands and forward-facing eyes, key features of modern primates.
- Had a long tail and rodent-like teeth for gnawing.
- Played an important role as a transitional species on the path toward true primates.

== The Emergence of True Primates: {euprimates}[Euprimates]

Around 55 million years ago, during the {eocene-epoch}[Eocene Epoch], the first true primates, known as _Euprimates_, evolved.
These early primates represented a significant advancement over their proto-primate ancestors.

Key features of Euprimates included::
- Grasping hands and feet with opposable thumbs and big toes, allowing them to easily climb and maneuver through trees. +
- Flattened nails instead of claws, improving their sense of touch and grip. +
- Forward-facing eyes, providing binocular vision and excellent depth perception. +
- Larger and more complex brains support better coordination and problem-solving abilities.

=== Major Groups of Primates

{adapiforms}[Adapiforms]::

- Similar in appearance and behavior to modern lemurs and lorises.
- Typically diurnal (active during the day).
- Had long snouts.
- Primarily ate fruits and leaves.
- It Gave rise to the _Strepsirrhines_ (lemurs and lorises).

{omomyiforms}[Omomyiforms]::

- Smaller, more agile, resembling modern tarsiers.
- Many were nocturnal, with large eyes adapted for low-light vision.
- Likely fed on insects and fruit.
- Thought to be ancestors of _Haplorhines_, including monkeys, apes, and humans.

== The Rise of Anthropoids: Higher Primates

Around 40 million years ago, during the Oligocene Epoch, Euprimates gave rise to a more advanced group known as {anthropoids}[Anthropoids] (higher primates).
These primates were the ancestors of all modern monkeys, apes, and humans.

Key developments in Anthropoids::
- Larger and more complex brains leading to improved intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and sophisticated social behaviors. +
- Enhanced binocular vision with forward-facing eyes and fully enclosed eye sockets (postorbital closure). +
- Larger bodies with reduced snouts and an increasing reliance on vision over smell. +
- Development of complex social groups, communication skills, and social hierarchies. +

=== Evolutionary Branches of Anthropoids

- One group migrated to South America, evolving into the _New World Monkeys_ {platyrrhines}[Platyrrhines] such as capuchins, howler monkeys, and spider monkeys.
Many of these species have prehensile tails.
- The other group remained in Africa and Asia, giving rise to the _Old World Monkeys_ (_Cercopithecoids_) such as baboons, macaques, and colobus monkeys.
These monkeys typically lack prehensile tails and include both tree-dwellers and ground-dwellers.

== The Emergence of {hominoids}[Hominoids]: The First Apes

Around 25 million years ago, during the Miocene Epoch, a group of Old World Monkeys in Africa evolved into the first apes, known as _Hominoids_.
This marked a major evolutionary shift in primate history.

Distinct traits of Hominoids::
- Lack of tails, allowing for greater mobility in the hips and pelvis.
- Larger, more complex brains supporting increased intelligence and social interaction.
- Highly flexible shoulders, wrists, and arms, enabling brachiation and more efficient climbing.

=== {proconsul}[Proconsul]

- Lived in Africa between 23 and 17 million years ago.
- Exhibited both monkey-like and ape-like traits.
- Walked on all fours (quadrupedal) along tree branches.
- Lacked a tail, had flexible limbs, and a more ape-like elbow joint.
- Likely lived in tropical forests, feeding on fruit.
- It Represented an early step toward the evolution of the Great Apes.

== The Rise of the Great Apes: {hominids}[Hominids]

Between 15 and 10 million years ago, during the late Miocene Epoch, the _Great Apes_ (Hominids) emerged.
This group includes modern orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans, along with their extinct ancestors.

Characteristics of Great Apes::
- Larger and more complex brains.
- Longer lifespans and sophisticated social structures.
- Larger bodies with no tails.
- Highly adaptable shoulder joints for powerful climbing and hanging.
- Varied diets and complex behaviors such as tool use and social learning.

=== Evolutionary Splits Within Hominids

- Around 14 million years ago: _Orangutans_ (genus *Pongo*) branched off and settled in Southeast Asia.
- About 10 million years ago: _Gorilla's_ (genus *Gorilla*) diverged in Africa.
- Between 6 and 8 million years ago, The last common ancestor of _Chimpanzees_ (genus *Pan*) and _Humans_ (genus *Homo*) existed.

== The First Hominins: Toward Human Evolution

After the split from chimpanzees, the human lineage began to evolve toward full bipedalism.

{sahelanthropus}[Sahelanthropus]::

- Lived about 7 million years ago in Chad, Central Africa.
- One of the oldest known species on the human family tree.
- Brain size of around 350 cubic centimeters (similar to modern chimpanzees).
- The Position of the foramen magnum suggests possible upright walking.
- Had small canine teeth, a more human-like trait.
- Likely lived in a mixed environment of forests and grasslands.
- Represents a key early step toward human evolution.

{orrorin}[Orrorin]::

- Lived about 6 million years ago in Kenya, East Africa.
- Evidence of bipedalism based on the structure of its thighbones.
