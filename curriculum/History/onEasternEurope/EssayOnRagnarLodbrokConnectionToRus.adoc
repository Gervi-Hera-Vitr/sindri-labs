{ragnar}[Ragnar Lodbrok] was a legendary Norse figure who {ragnar-tale}[_has many sagas_].
While Ragnar and Ukraine are not directly tied to one another,
there are indirect links between the Norse vikings and modern-day Ukraine.

This is through {varangians}[*_Varangian_*] and {rus}[*_Kyivan Rus'_*].
And here are all the possible connections:

Varangians and the Kyivan Rus'::
During the viking age (8th‚Äì11th century) Norse traders, warriors, settlers, known as Varangians,
ventured eastward to Eastern Europe.
They established *_trade routes_* and _settlements_ along rivers like {dnipro}[Dnipro] and Volga.
These varangians were instrumental in the founding of the Kyivan Rus'
-- a *federation* of *_Slavic and Norse Tribes_* centered in {kyiv}[Kyiv].

Ragnar's sons like {bjorn}[Bj√∂rn Ironside] and {ivar}[Ivar the Boneless] are often tide to stories of viking expansion in those regions.

Rurik and the Rurikid Dynasty::
A significant connection of Vikings to Ukraine lies in {rurik}[_the Norse prince Rurik_],
who is credited with founding the Rurikid Dynasty around 862.
The Rurikid Dynasty was a powerful entity that ruled the Kyivan Rus' for centuries and established Kyiv as a powerful political and cultural center.

Rurik was a Varangian.
Ultimately, there are lots of myths and legends of other connections between Vikings and Ukraine.
Some of these are more historical, but most seem less supported as they are more speculative.

In the end, Ragnar had a certain amount of indirect influence on Ukraine.
This influence stemmed more from the Varangian cultural helping shape the multinational and proto-democratic Rus' peoples
rather than from Ragnar as a person who was influential.
