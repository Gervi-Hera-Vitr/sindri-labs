= Psychology Lecture Notes: Language Structure and Acquisition

== Part 1: Introduction - Language as Battleground of Human Nature

=== Language's Central Role in Understanding Human Nature

*Why Language Matters:*
- Study of human language = battleground over theories of human nature
- Every major thinker about people has had to address language

*Historical Figures Who Addressed Language:*
- Aristotle
- Plato
- Hume
- Locke
- Freud
- Skinner

*Modern Approaches That Must Address Language:*
- Computational theory
- Cognitive neuroscience
- Evolutionary theory
- Cultural psychology

*Central Claim:*
- If you hope to make it with a theory of what people are and how people work, you HAVE to explain and talk about language

*Dedicated Field:*
- Unlike most psychological topics, language has entire field devoted to its study
- Linguistics: Entirely devoted to studying nuances and structures of different languages

'''

=== Definitional Point: What Counts as Language?

*Narrow Definition (Scientific Sense):*

Systems like:
- English
- Dutch
- Warlpiri
- Italian
- Turkish
- Urdu
- Various sign languages

*Broader Possible Definition:*
- Could use "language" to describe what dogs do
- What chimpanzees do
- What birds do
- Music ("musical language")
- Art
- Any communicative system

*Why Narrow Definition Is Necessary:*

*Problem with Broad Definition:*
- If language refers to everything from English to traffic signals
- Cannot find interesting generalizations
- Cannot do good science
- Becomes scientifically useless

*Scientific Strategy:*
1. Restrict to systems like English, Dutch, American Sign Language, Navajo
2. Make generalizations about language in this narrow sense
3. Then ask: To what extent do other systems (like animal communication) relate to this narrower definition?
4. After understanding narrow sense, can explore what other communicative systems share those properties

'''

== Part 2: Darwin's Claim - Language as Instinct

=== Darwin's Assertion

*Quote:*
> "Man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children, while no child has an instinctive tendency to bake, brew or write."

*Darwin's Claim:*
- Language is special
- Some sort of propensity, capacity, or instinct for language
- Unlike other cultural activities (baking, brewing, writing)
- Not everything comes natural to us
- But language does come naturally

'''

=== Evidence 1: Universality of Language

*Basic Fact:*
- Every normal human society has language

*Historical Evidence:*
- Course of traveling: Cultures encounter other cultures
- Often encounter very different cultures
- BUT: Through entire course of human history, nobody has ever encountered another group of humans that did not have a language

*Does Universality Prove It's Built In?*

*Not Necessarily - Alternative Explanation:*
- Could be cultural innovation
- Language might be such a good idea that every culture comes across it and develops it independently

*Analogy - Eating Utensils:*
- Just about every culture uses some sort of utensils to eat food with
- Knife and fork
- Chopsticks
- Spoon
- This probably NOT because use of eating utensils is human nature
- Rather: It's just very useful thing that cultures discover over and over again

'''

=== Evidence 2: Pidgins and Creoles - Language Creation in Single Generation

*Stronger Evidence:*
- Demonstrated case studies where language is created within a single generation
- These case studies have happened over history

*Standard Example: Slave Trade Context*

*Setup:*
- Slave trade revolving around tobacco, cotton, coffee, or sugar
- Would mix slaves and laborers from different language backgrounds
- Part of this mixing was deliberate: To avoid possibility of revolt

*Result - Pidgin Development:*
- Enslaved people from different cultures would develop makeshift communication system
- Could talk to one another
- Called a "pidgin" (p-i-d-g-i-n)

*Characteristics of Pidgin:*
- NOT a language
- Strings of words borrowed from different languages around them
- Put together in haphazard ways
- No rich structure

*Critical Question:*
- What happens to children raised in this society?

*Expected Outcome:*
- Might expect children would come to speak pidgin

*Actual Outcome:*
- They DON'T speak pidgin
- In course of single generation, they develop their own language
- They CREATE a language with:
- Rich syntax
- Rich morphology
- Rich phonology

*This New Language = Creole:*
- Languages we know now as creoles
- Word refers back to their history
- Means they were developed from pidgins

*Significance:*
- Suggests ability to use, understand, and learn language is part of human nature
- Doesn't require extensive cultural history
- Just about any normal child, even when not exposed to full-fledged language, can create a language

'''

=== Evidence 3: Modern Case Studies - Nicaraguan Sign Language

*Context:*
- Deaf children acquiring sign language
- Adults teaching them are not versed in sign language
- Adults are second-language learners struggling along

*Expected Outcome:*
- Children would use whatever system their adults use

*Actual Outcome:*
- They DON'T use adult system
- They "creolize" it
- Take makeshift communication system developed by adults
- Turn it into full-blown language

*Interpretation:*
- To some extent, it's part of human nature to create languages

'''

=== Evidence 4: Universal Acquisition in Normal Humans

*Basic Facts:*

*Not Everyone Can Do Everything:*
- Not everybody in room can ride bicycle
- Not everybody in room can play chess

*But Everybody Has Language:*
- Every person possesses at least one language
- Everybody started to possess at least one language when they were child

*Exceptions:*
- Exist, but come about due to some sort of brain damage
- Any neurologically normal human will come to possess a language

'''

=== Evidence 5: Neurological Studies

*Brain Specialization:*
- Dedicated parts of brain that work for language
- Referred to in earlier chapters on brain

*Consequences of Brain Damage:*
- If these parts of brain are damaged: Get language deficits
- Aphasias: Might lose ability to understand or create language

'''

=== Evidence 6: Genetic Basis (More Speculative)

*Recent Work:*
- Studying genetic basis of language
- Looking at genes directly responsible for capacity to learn and use language

*Evidence:*
- Some unfortunate people have point mutations in these genes
- Such people are unable to learn and use language

*General Conclusion:*
- At very broad level, some support for claim that language is in some sense part of human nature

'''

== Part 3: What All Languages Share - Universal Properties

=== Creativity of Language (Descartes' Argument)

*René Descartes' Philosophical Position:*
- We are more than merely machines
- Best piece of evidence: Human capacity for language

*Why Machines Couldn't Have Language (According to Descartes):*
- Our capacity for language is unbounded and free
- We could say anything we choose to say
- We have free will

*Productivity:*
- Language allows us to produce virtual infinity of sentences
- We could create and understand sentences we never heard before

'''

=== Number of Possible Sentences

*Question:*
- How many grammatical sentences under twenty words in English?

*Answer:*
- "A lot"

*Implication:*
- Any theory of language use and language comprehension cannot simply appeal to a list
- When you understand a sentence, you have to have capacity to understand sentence even if you've never heard it before

*Novel Sentences:*
- We could effortlessly produce and understand sentences that no human has ever said before on earth

*Examples of Novel Sentences:*

1. "It's surprisingly easy to get a purple tie on eBay if you don't care much about quality."
2. "I am upset that one cannot easily download 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' through iTunes."

*Key Point:*
- Possible nobody has said these sentences before
- But you probably have not heard them
- Yet you understand them immediately

*Mechanism:*
- How do you do it?
- You have rules in your head
- You've learned what words mean
- But you have abstract and unconscious rules that:
- Take these words
- Figure out the order
- In fraction of second, give rise to understanding

*This Is What Linguists Study*

'''

=== Examples of Unconscious Rules

*Important Note:*
- Rules we're talking about are NOT rules you explicitly know
- They're automatic rules
- Same sort as visual perception rules
- Implicit and unconscious
- Not accessible to explicit understanding

*Example 1: "Eager to Eat" vs. "Easy to Eat"*

- "The pig is eager to eat"
- "The pig is easy to eat"

*Immediate Understanding:*
- In fraction of second, you know there's important difference
- "The pig is eager to eat" = pig does the eating
- "The pig is easy to eat" = pig is being eaten

*Example 2: Pronoun Reference*

- "Bill knew that John liked him"

*Possible Meanings:*
- Could mean: Bill knew that John liked Bill
- Could mean: Bill knew that John liked Fred

*Cannot Mean:*
- Cannot mean: Bill knew that John liked John

*Natural Interpretation:*
- Bill knew that John liked Bill
- The two words co-refer

*Contrast:*
- "Bill knew that John liked himself"
- Only has meaning: Bill knew that John liked John

*Professional Linguistics:*
- "This is what linguists do for a living"
- If this interests you: "You should become a linguist"

'''

=== Three Structures of Language

*Language Has Multiple Levels of Structure:*
- From bottom to top
- All human languages have these

*Three Core Structures:*

1. **Phonology:** System of sounds or signs
2. **Morphology:** System of words or morphemes (basic units of meaning)
3. **Syntax:** Rules and principles that put together words and phrases into meaningful utterances

*Source:*
- Discussion indebted to Steven Pinker's excellent book "The Language Instinct"
- Provides superb discussion of these phenomena
- Many examples borrowed from Pinker

'''

== Part 4: Phonology - The System of Sounds

=== Basic Definition

*Phonology:*
- The system of sounds that languages have

*Setting Aside:*
- For moment, putting aside question of sign languages and how they work
- Will return to sign languages later

'''

=== Phonemes: Limited Set of Sounds

*Finite List:*
- Finite list of possible sounds that language can use

*English Example:*
- English has about forty phonemes

*How It Works for Native English Speakers:*
- If you're native monolingual speaker of English
- You hear speech
- Each sound you hear is categorized as falling into one of those forty phonemes

'''

=== Example: English "L" and "R" Phonemes

*English Distinction:*
- English has phoneme of "l" (/l/)
- English has phoneme of "r" (/r/)

*Result for English Speakers:*
- English speaker can hear difference between "lip" and "rip"
- Corresponds to two different words in English

*Other Languages:*
- Don't have that distinction
- Those distinctions very difficult for non-native English speakers to learn

'''

=== Learning Phonemes

*Part of Language Learning:*
- You have to learn the phonemes that your language has

'''

=== Word Boundary Problem

*Another Part of Learning:*
- Have to figure out what the boundaries are between words
- Have to use sound signals to figure out boundaries between words

*Seems Like Non-Problem for English Speakers:*
- If only language you've ever heard is English
- Going to seem like really weird example of a problem
- You're listening to lecturer speak
- Between each word you're hearing a pause
- Don't have to be very smart to figure out where one word begins and ends

*But: The Pause Is Psychological Illusion*

*Reality:*
- If you were to talk into oscilloscope that measured sound vibrations
- There are NO pauses between words
- Rather: Pauses are inserted by your mind
- You already know where one word begins and another ends
- You insert pause at that point

'''

=== Demonstration: Foreign Language Without Pauses

*French Example:*

*If You've Never Heard French:*
- When you hear somebody say "Je ne sais pas"
- You could say: "Remarkable! French has no pauses between words"

*French Speaker:*
- Of course hears: "Je ne sais pas" (with pauses)

*Hebrew Example:*
- "Sleecha, eypho ha-sheeruteem" (request for bathroom)
- If you don't know Hebrew: No pauses

*Truth About Demonstrations:*
- When each person gave their language demonstrations
- Nobody spoke properly
- Instead of sentence with pauses
- All sounded like "blublublublublub" without any pauses
- Because lecturer doesn't know those languages

'''

=== Children's Challenge

*Starting Point:*
- Children come into world without knowing any specific language
- Have to learn pauses
- Have to learn to interpret sounds in context

*Result:*
- Sometimes they make mistakes
- Get problems of segmentation

'''

=== Segmentation Errors in Children

*Can See Mistakes:*
- When children trying to repeat back something already known within society
- Songs are good example

*Example 1:*
- "I'll never be your pizza burnin'"
- Actual: "Beast of burden" (Rolling Stones)

*Example 2:*
- "A girl with colitis goes by"
- Actual: "A girl with kaleidoscope eyes" (Beatles)

*Example 3:*
- "The ants are my friends; they're blowin' in the wind"
- Actual: "The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind" (Bob Dylan)

*Example 4 (Religious):*
- "Our father with Bart in heaven; Harold be they name… Lead us not into Penn Station…"
- Actual: "Our Father who art in heaven; Hallowed be thy name… Lead us not into temptation…"

'''

=== Top-Down Processing in Phonological Understanding

*Concept:*
- Phonological understanding illustrates aspects of language processing and consciousness
- Typically, when you hear sentence: You manufacture in your mind gaps between words
- When something unclear: You'll fill in gap and figure out what word is
- You'll hear it that way

*Best Examples:*
- When it goes wrong

'''

=== Classic Example: "Super Freak" by Rick James

*Setup:*
- Song by Rick James
- Note: Lecturer mentions concern about copyright laws

*The Ambiguous Line:*
- "The kind of girl you read about--"
- What comes next?

*Nobody Really Knows:*
- Sounds to many people (top-down interpretation) like:
- "She's the kind of girl you read about in Newsweek magazine"

*Problem:*
- Makes no sense given context
- "You don't want to bring home to Mama"
- Doesn't fit

*Actual Lyric:*
- According to song notes:
- "The kind of girl you read about in new wave magazines"

*Perceptual Effect:*
- Once you know this
- When you listen again, you hear it that way

'''

=== Top-Down Processing Defined

*Definition:*
- When you know what something is, you hear it that way

*Extremely Useful:*
- Comes to filling in gaps in sounds

*Normal Conversation:*
- If speaker says "s-- entence"
- You won't hear "s-- entence"
- Rather, you hear "sentence"
- You fill in gap

'''

=== Problems with Top-Down Processing

*Personal Example: "Get Crunk"*

*Background:*
- Children (8 and 10 years old) asked to buy "Get Crunk" from iTunes
- Lecturer aware song contains consistent refrain:
- "Get crunk" [extremely bad word] "get crunk" [extremely bad word]
- Lecturer said no

*Clean Version:*
- Children said there's clean version
- Lecturer downloaded clean version

*Problem:*
- Knowing what the word is means clean version is not very clean to lecturer
- Top-down knowledge makes censored version still sound offensive

*Note:*
- This IS the clean version
- "Thank goodness they took away that obscene word"

'''

=== Top-Down Processing: General Benefits

*Summary:*
- Top-down processing affects how we hear things
- Usually, almost always, for the better
- What we know can clear things up

*Preview:*
- This is theme we'll return to next class with vision
- How we see world is often confusing and befuddled
- But what we know can clear things up
- Same with sound

'''

== Part 5: Morphology - The System of Words

=== Definition

*Phonology = Sounds*
*Morphology = Words*

'''

=== Arbitrariness of the Sign (Ferdinand de Saussure)

*Amazing Trick of Human Language:*
- Described by Ferdinand de Saussure (great linguist)
- "The arbitrariness of the sign"

*What It Means:*
- Can take any arbitrary idea in the world
- Idea of chair
- Story
- Country
- Make sound or sign to connect to it
- Link is arbitrary

'''

=== Limits and Flexibility of Arbitrary Naming

*Some Partial Connections:*
- Might choose word for "dog" as "woof woof" (sounds like dog)
- BUT: Can't use word for "country" that sounds like country

*Sign Language:*
- Could use sign for "drink" that looks sort of like act of drinking
- BUT: Can't use sign for "country" that looks like country
- Can't use sign for "idea" that looks like idea

*Core Principle:*
- Languages work through arbitrary naming
- Allows for map between:
- Symbol (e.g., spoken word)
- Any sort of thought we want to use

*Result:*
- Those arbitrary mappings, as we learn them, make up vocabulary of language

'''

=== Morphemes vs. Words

*Talking About Words But:*
- More technical term is "morpheme"

*Definition of Morpheme:*
- Smallest meaningful unit in a language

*Often Same as Word:*
- "Dog" is a word
- "Dog" is also a morpheme

*But Not Always:*
- Single morphemes exist
- Words composed of many morphemes also exist

'''

=== Multi-Morpheme Words

*Examples:*
- "Dogs" = one word, but two morphemes
- "Complained" = one word, but two morphemes

*What This Means:*
- Make word by putting together two morphemes

*Implication:*
- To know what "dogs" means, you never had to learn the word "dogs"
- All you had to know:
- Word "dog"
- Plural morpheme 's'
- Could put them together to create word

'''

=== Size of Vocabulary

*Question:*
- How many morphemes does average speaker know?

*Answer:*
- Fairly startling
- Low-ball estimate: About 60,000 words
- Proper estimate closer to: 80,000 or 100,000 words

*What This Means:*
- If you average it out
- Children start learning first words at about first year of life
- They learn about nine new words a day

*Pattern:*
- Not continuous nine words every day
- Goes up and down depending on age
- But still: Amount of words we know is staggering

'''

=== Multilingual Speakers

*Question for Class:*
- "How many of you know more than one language pretty fluently?"

*Implication:*
- Those who know other languages might have:
- 200,000 words in their heads
- Or 300,000 words
- Accessing them in fraction of second

*Assessment:*
- Could legitimately be seen as one of most astonishing things that people do

'''

== Part 6: Syntax - Communicating Complicated Ideas

=== Building Blocks So Far

*What We Have:*
- Sound system of language (phonology)
- Words of language (morphology)

*What That Gives:*
- "Dog," "cup," "chair," "house," "story," "idea"

*Problem:*
- Won't allow us to communicate complicated ideas

'''

=== Definition and Purpose of Syntax

*Syntax:*
- Refers to rules and principles that allow us to:
- Combine words into phrases
- Combine phrases into sentences

'''

=== Another Neat Trick: "Infinite Use of Finite Media"

*Defined by Wilhelm von Humboldt:*
- "The infinite use of finite media"

*The Question:*
- Your vocabulary is finite
- Just so many words
- Have to learn them one by one
- But: Could produce virtual infinity of sentences
- How can you do that?
- How go from finite list of symbols to infinite number of sentences?

*The Answer:*
- You have a combinatorial system

'''

=== Other Combinatorial Systems

*Language Not Unique:*

*Music:*
- Has combinatorial system
- Finite number of notes
- Limitless number of musical compositions

*DNA:*
- Has combinatorial system
- Finite number of bases or amino acids
- Could combine to possible infinity of DNA strings

'''

=== The Infinity Mechanism: Recursion

*Key Concept:*
- Many familiar with this from mathematics or computer science
- Recursion

*Can Be Illustrated Simply in Language*

'''

=== Simple Language Example

*Very Simple Language:*
- Not actual language but close to how linguists describe normal languages

*Vocabulary:*
- Three nouns: "Fred," "Barney," "Wilma"
- Two verbs: "thinks," "likes"

*One Rule:*
- How to read: You make sentence by taking:
- Noun (any noun)
- Putting verb after it
- Following verb with noun

*Example Sentence:*
- "Fred likes Wilma"

*Question:*
- How many possible sentences are there?

'''

=== Calculating Possible Sentences

*Answer:*
- Eighteen sentences

*The Sentences:*
- "Fred likes Fred"
- "Fred likes Barney"
- "Fred likes Wilma"
- "Fred thinks Fred"
- "Fred thinks Barney"
- "Fred thinks Wilma"
- And so on...

*Pattern:*
- Three nouns
- Followed by any of two verbs
- Followed by any of three nouns
- 3 × 2 × 3 = 18

*Assessment:*
- Not very interesting language

'''

=== More Complicated Language with Recursion

*Same Vocabulary:*
- Same three nouns
- Same two verbs
- Same sentence structure as before

*But Now:*
- One other sentence rule
- This sentence expands to:
- Noun followed by verb followed by SENTENCE

*Key Feature:*
- One rule invoking another rule
- Then you get recursion

*Example:*
- "Fred thinks Barney likes Wilma"

*Result:*
- Here you get potential infinity of sentences

'''

=== Recursion in Everyday Language

*Obviously Toy Example But:*
- Can see use of recursion in everyday life and language use

*Examples:*

*Simple:*
- "John hates cheese"

*Embedding Level 1:*
- "My roommate heard a rumor that John hates cheese"

*Embedding Level 2:*
- "It disturbed Mary when I told her that my roommate heard a rumor that John hates cheese"

*Embedding Level 3:*
- "I was amazed that it disturbed Mary when I told her that my roommate heard a rumor that John hates cheese"

*Embedding Level 4:*
- "Professor Bloom had devoted way too much of his lecture talking about how I was amazed that it disturbed Mary when I told her that my roommate heard a rumor that John hates cheese"

*Embedding Level 5:*
- "It really bothered me that--"

*Key Point:*
- There's no limit
- There's no longest sentence
- Could keep producing sentence deeper and deeper embedded until you die
- This is part of power of language

'''

=== Complexity of Syntactic Rules

*Important Point:*
- Syntactic rules are complicated

*Puzzle:*
- Different rules can conspire to create same sentence

'''

=== Ambiguity Example: Groucho Marx

*Classic Line:*
- "I once shot an elephant in my pajamas. How it got into my pajamas I'll never know."

*Humor:*
- Revolves around ambiguity of rules that generate it
- Two possible structures:
- I [shot an elephant] [in my pajamas]
- I [shot] [an elephant in my pajamas]

'''

=== Poorly Thought-Out Headlines

*Purpose:*
- To illustrate issues of ambiguity
- People have collected newspaper headlines that inadvertently have ambiguity

*Examples:*

1. "Complaints about NBA referees growing ugly"
- Referees becoming ugly? Or complaints becoming ugly?

2. "Kids make nutritious snacks"
- Kids prepare snacks? Or kids ARE snacks?

3. "No one was injured in a blast which was attributed to the buildup of gas by one town official"
- Gas buildup caused blast? Or town official attributed blast to gas?

4. "General arrested for fondling privates"
- Fondling private parts? Or fondling private soldiers?
- (From Korea University visit)

'''

=== Difficulty of Avoiding Ambiguity

*General Problem:*
- Ambiguity is actually quite difficult to avoid in construction and understanding of sentences
- One of ways it's often difficult to write clearly

*Legal Applications:*
- Whole sub-field of law involving:
- Use of linguistic theory to disambiguate sentences
- In Constitution
- In legislation
- In criminal cases

'''

=== Serious Criminal Case Example

*Background:*
- Several years ago
- Very serious criminal case that rested on a sentence

*The Situation:*

*Characters:*
- Two brothers (one retarded, one not)
- Police officer

*Events:*
1. Brothers get into robbery
2. Police officer sees them and points gun at them
3. One brother points gun at police officer
4. Police officer shouts to non-retarded brother: "Give me the gun"
5. Retarded brother shouts: "Let him have it"
6. Brother shoots and kills police officer

*Legal Question:*
- Brother who did shooting: Plainly a murderer
- What about brother who shouted "Let him have it"?

*Depends on Interpretation:*
- Sentence is beautifully ambiguous
- Could mean: "Shoot him, let him have it"
- Could mean: "Give him the gun, let him have it"

*Trial Outcome:*
- Understanding was he was found guilty
- A lot turned on ambiguity of sentence

'''

== Part 7: Question and Answer on Language Structure

=== Question 1: Syntax vs. Grammar

*Student Question:*
- How does syntax differ from grammar or are they exactly the same?

*Answer:*
- They're exactly the same
- Syntax is more technical term
- But means same thing as grammar

'''

=== Question 2: People Without Language Exposure

*Student Question:*
- You said every normal human being born uses at some point some kind of language
- Aren't there people who weren't born within culture and grew up and never really spoke language though physically normal?

*Lecturer's Clarification:*
- Glad question was asked
- As said, realized statement wasn't quite right

*Revised Statement:*
- Said: Everybody who's neurologically normal comes to acquire and learn language
- But: What about people who are neurologically normal but don't have language around them?

*Historical Cases:*

*1. Children Raised by Animals:*
- Probably apocryphal stories
- Children raised by wolves or dogs

*2. Child Abuse Cases:*
- Horrible stories, some in twentieth century
- Children locked away by insane or evil parents
- Never learned to speak

*3. Linguistic Isolates:*
- Deaf people within certain societies
- Nobody signs to them
- They themselves never learn to speak

*What These Cases Tell Us:*
- Dramatic exception
- Not enough to have brain for language
- Somebody does have to use it with you

'''

=== Counterexample: Deaf Children Creating Language

*Interestingly:*
- Doesn't have to be that many people

*Susan Goldin-Meadow's Research:*
- Studied deaf children that nobody signed to
- BUT: Studied deaf children with deaf siblings
- These children don't just sit there
- They create their own language

*Characteristics:*
- Not full-blown language like:
- American Sign Language
- Langue des signes québécoise
- But: It's a language nonetheless
- Has: Words, syntax, and phonology

'''

=== Question 3: Inherent Limits to Grammar

*Student Question:*
- Could it be argued there are inherent limits to grammar?

*Answer:*
- Good question
- Most linguists would argue "yes"
- Languages are highly constrained in how they do things

*Examples of Constraints:*

1. **No Language Has:*
- Rule that constructs question by switching order of words around in sentence

2. **No Language Has:*
- Rule that says fifth word has to be verb

*Universal Constraints:*
- Linguists have all these conditions
- "No language in the world works this way"

*Significance:*
- Constraints tell us what's humanly natural language versus what's not humanly natural language

*But Notice:*
- Even if incredible constraints on grammars
- Still: Could still produce infinite number of sentences
- Like if you restrict to only subset of numbers (only odd numbers)
- Still infinity of odd numbers

*Conclusion:*
- Grammar can be restricted but still give rise to infinity of possible sentences

'''

== Part 8: Noam Chomsky and Language Acquisition

=== Chomsky's Radical Claim

*Background:*
- Met Chomsky when talked about behaviorism
- Wrote "A Review of Verbal Behavior"
- Linguist Noam Chomsky

*The Radical Claim:*
- We shouldn't view language learning as learning at all
- Instead: Should view it as something similar to growth

'''

=== Chomsky's Argument (Quote)

*Quote:*
> "No one would take seriously the proposal that a human organism learns through experience to have arms rather than wings, or that the basic structure of particular organs results from accidental experience. [Language] proves to be no less marvelous and intricate than these physical structures. Why, then, should we not study the acquisition of a cognitive structure like language more or less as we study some complex bodily organ?"

*Implications:*

*You Might Learn:*
- To play baseball
- About American Civil War

*But If Chomsky Is Right:*
- You didn't LEARN to speak English
- Rather: What happened is you heard English
- But capacity GREW in your head
- Something lot more similar to development of:
- Arms
- Legs
- Visual system

'''

=== Should We Believe Chomsky?

*Evidence for Environmental Influence:*

*Obviously:*
- Has to be some effect of environment shaping language

*Why?*
- In order to know English: Have to have heard English
- In order to know Dutch: Have to have learned and heard Dutch

*And:*
- Languages differ in all ways we were talking about

'''

=== Three Ways Languages Differ (Must Be Learned)

*1. Phonology:*

*English:*
- Has distinction between 'l' and 'r'

*Other Languages:*
- Do not have this distinction

'''

*2. Morphology:*

*Example: Word for Dog*

*English:*
- Referred to with morpheme "dog"
- Historical accident of English

*French:*
- "Chien"

*Greek:*
- Something else

*Each of 6,000 Languages:*
- Has different word
- Vietnamese: This
- Urdu: This
- Czech: That

'''

*3. Syntax:*

*English:*
- Subject-verb-object language
- To convey idea that Bill hit John, say: "Bill hit John"

*But Not All Languages Work That Way:*
- In fact, majority of languages are actually subject-object-verb languages
- Would say: "Bill John hit"

*All of This:*
- Has to be learned
- Has to be learned through exposure to language users

'''

=== Evidence Supporting Chomsky's Growth Model

*On the Other Hand:*
- Considerable evidence that development of language skills, in some way, is similar to growth in way Chomsky suggests

'''

== Part 9: Basic Facts About Language Development

=== Fact 1: All Normal Children Learn Language

*Universal Acquisition:*
- All normal children learn language

'''

=== Fact 2: Specific Language Impairments Exist

*Can Be Due to Trauma:*
- Aphasias
- Trauma
- Blow to head
- Stroke can rid you of your language

*Also Genetic Disorders:*
- Some falling under rubric of "specific language impairment"
- Children born without same ability as rest of us to learn to speak

=== Significance of Specific Language Impairments

*Why Interesting:*
- Illustrate something about human language

*Reasonable Pre-Lecture Assumptions:*
- "All you need to have to learn language is to be smart"
- "All you need to have to learn language is to want to communicate"
- "All you need to have to learn language is to be social person wanting to/having ability to understand others and deal with others"

*But:*
- Cases of specific language impairments suggest all of that is WRONG

*Evidence:*
- There are children in this world right now who are:
- Plenty smart
- Really want to communicate
- Entirely social creatures
- But: They can't learn language

*Implication:*
- Ability to learn and understand language is to some extent separate from these other aspects of mental life

'''

=== Fact 3: Language Learned Without Feedback or Training

*Myth:*
- Many Americans believe they need to teach their children language

*Huge Industry:*
- DVDs
- Flash cards
- All sorts of things designed to teach children language

*Many Parents Believe:*
- If they didn't persist in using these things, children would never learn to speak

*But We Know That's Not True:*

'''

=== Evidence from Cultures That Don't Speak to Children

*Communities Exist:*
- Where they don't speak to their kids
- Don't believe it's important to speak to kids

*Linguist Interviews:*

*Linguists Would Ask:*
- "Why don't you speak to your babies?"

*Adults Would Respond:*
- "It'd be ridiculous to speak to a baby"
- "Baby has nothing to say"
- "You might as well just speak to your dog"

*American Linguist Would Say:*
- "Yeah. We speak to our dogs."

*Cultural Difference:*
- Americans and Europeans speak to everything and everybody
- Other cultures more picky
- Don't talk to their children until children themselves are talking

*Result:*
- Doesn't seem to make much difference in language learning

'''

=== Studies on Feedback

*Motivated by:*
- Chomsky's work
- Chomsky's critique of Skinner's "Verbal Behavior"

*Question:*
- What if we looked at children within United States?
- Don't these children get feedback?

*Answer:*
- Yes and no

*Average Highly Educated Western Parent:*
- DOES give children feedback based on what they say

*But:*
- Don't typically give feedback based on:
- Syntax
- Grammaticality of what they say

'''

=== Classic Study: Brown and Hanlon (1970s)

*Study:*
- Did all these studies looking at:
- What children say
- How parents responded

*Findings:*
- Parents respond NOT to grammatical correctness
- But TO:
- Affect
- Cuteness
- Sociability of utterance

*Example 1:*

*Child Says:*
- "I loves you, Mommy"

*Unusual Parent Would Say:*
- "Oh, no. The verb agreement is mistaken"
- "You've added a redundant 's.'"
- "It's not appropriate"

*Typical Response:*
- Accept and appreciate message

*Example 2:*

*Child Says:*
- "I hate your guts, Mother"

*Unusual Mother Would Say:*
- "That's wonderful"
- "There's a subject, verb, object"
- "The whole thing's structurally fine"

*Typical Response:*
- Respond to negative message

'''

=== General Pattern

*We Respond:*
- To our kids like we respond to each other
- Based on message that's conveyed
- NOT grammaticality of utterances

*Children's Mistakes:*
- Children make grammatical mistakes all the time
- But then they go away
- They go away WITHOUT correction

'''

== Part 10: Time Course of Language Acquisition

=== Very Early: Melody Preference (4 Days Old)

*Studies Done in France:*
- With four-day-old babies

*Method:*
- Used sucking method
- Remember: Limited number of things babies can do
- One thing: Suck

*Procedure:*
- Babies would suck on pacifier to hear French
- Would prefer to hear French than to hear Russian

*Investigators' Claim:*
- Because they had been exposed to French in first four days of their lives

*Reviewers Objected:*
- Mostly from France
- "No. Maybe French just sounds better"
- "Everybody's going to like French"

*So:*
- Re-did study in Russia
- Russian kids sucked harder to hear Russian than French

*What They're Listening To:*
- Isn't the words (don't know words yet)
- Don't know syntax yet
- It's rhythm of language

*For Adults:*
- French and Russian sound different
- Even if you don't know word of either language
- They still sound different
- Sound different to babies too

*Baby Knowledge:*
- Baby being raised in France or Russia knows enough to tell:
- What's his language
- What isn't

'''

=== Early On: Universal Phoneme Sensitivity

*Children Sensitive to Every Phoneme:*
- Early on, children are sensitive to every phoneme there is

*Example:*

*English-Speaking Babies:*
- Babies born in United States can distinguish between:
- English phonemes like "lip" and "rip"

*But Also:*
- Could distinguish between phonemic contrasts NOT exemplified in English
- Such as phonemic contrasts in:
- Czech
- Hindi

'''

=== Around 12 Months: Loss of Non-Native Phoneme Sensitivity

*Goes Away:*
- Around twelve months of age

*You Were Better as Baby:*
- This is one thing you were much better at when you were baby than you are now
- When you were baby: Multilingual fool
- Could understand sound differences of every language on earth

*Now:*
- If you're like lecturer: "Could barely understand English"
- You narrow down until you're sensitive just to language you hear

*Timeline:*
- This narrowing down largely in place by about twelve months of age

'''

=== Around 7 Months: Babbling

*Sign Language Babbling:*
- Promised to return to issue of sign language
- Going to show film
- Very elegant series of experiments

*Question:*
- Do babies who are exposed to sign language, babble?

*Surprising Finding:*
- Over last 10-20 years in field
- Acquisition of sign languages has turned out to be almost exactly the same
- In fact, as far as we know: Exactly the same as acquisition of spoken languages

*Didn't Have to Be That Way:*
- Could have been just as reasonable to expect:
- Advantage for speech over sign
- Sign languages may be full-blown languages
- But just take longer—harder to learn
- Because brain and body adapted for speech

*Turns Out:*
- This just isn't the case
- Sign and spoken languages:
- Developmental milestones precisely the same
- Start babbling at same point
- Start using first words
- First sentences
- First complicated constructions

*No Interesting Difference:*
- Between how brain comes to acquire and use:
- Spoken language versus sign language

'''

=== Around 12 Months: First Words

*Children Start Using First Words:*
- Around twelve months of age

*Characteristics:*
- Words for objects and actions
- Like: "dog," "up," "milk"

*Also:*
- Start showing some sensitivity to order of words
- Know that "dog bites cat" is different from "cat bites dog"

'''

=== Around 18 Months: Word Learning Acceleration

*Start Learning Words Faster:*

*Also:*
- Start producing little, miniature sentences
- Like: "Want cookie" or "Milk spill"

*Function Morphemes Appear:*
- Little words: "in," "of," "a," "the"
- Start to gradually appear

'''

=== Around 7 Years Through Puberty: Critical Period

*Then the Bad News:*

*Around Seven Years Going Up Through Puberty:*
- Ability to learn language starts to go away

'''

=== Best Research on Critical Period

*Researchers:*
- Elissa Newport
- Sam Supalla

*Study:*
- People who have been in United States for many, many years (30-40 years)
- Seeing how well they have come to speak English

*Key Finding:*
- Big determinant of how well you speak English as immigrant:
- NOT how smart you are
- NOT how many family members you have
- NOT your motivation
- It's how old you were when you started

'''

=== Critical Period Details

*Timeline:*

*Start Learning Second Language Within First Few Years of Life:*
- You're fine
- You'll speak like native

*But Then:*
- Starts getting worse and worse

*Once You Hit Puberty:*
- Suddenly huge variation in abilities to learn language
- Very rare for somebody who learned English past puberty to speak without accent

*Accent:*
- Very hard to shake
- Not just accent
- Also other aspects of:
- Phonology
- Syntax
- Morphology

*Metaphor:*
- Like part of brain responsible for language learning is only around early in development
- If you don't get your language by then, it'll just run out
