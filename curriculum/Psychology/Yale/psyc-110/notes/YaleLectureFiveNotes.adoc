= Psychology Lecture Notes: Piaget, Cognitive Development, and Infant Cognition

== Part 1: Jean Piaget - Theoretical Framework

=== Historical Influence

*Current Impact:*

* Most modern methods, theories, and ideas in developmental psychology shaped by Piaget's influence
* Foundational figure in cognitive development research

=== Core Philosophical Position

*Children as Active Thinkers:*

* Not passive recipients of information
* Actively trying to figure out the world
* Described as "little scientists"

*Ambitious Foundational Goal:*

* Did NOT initially study children out of interest in children per se
* Primary interest: Emergence of knowledge in general
* Discipline he created: "Genetic epistemology" (origins of knowledge)

*Theoretical Reasoning:*

* Studied individual child development as window into knowledge development generally
* Believed ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny

*"Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny":*

* Definition: Development of individual mimics/repeats development of species
* Status: Entirely not true
* But: Beautiful phrase and Piaget committed to this principle
* Logic: How a kid develops → tells us about development of knowledge more generally

'''

=== Two Core Learning Mechanisms

*1. Assimilation:*

* Expanding the range of things you respond to
* Extending existing schemas to new objects/situations
* Example: Baby accustomed to sucking on breast → comes to suck on bottle, then rattle
* Psychological sense: Have a way of looking at world → expand it to encompass new things

*2. Accommodation:*

* Changing HOW you respond
* Modifying existing schemas when they don't fit
* Example: Baby forms mouth differently depending on what's being sucked
* More generally: Change your system of knowledge itself to fit reality

*Interaction of Mechanisms:*

* Both mechanisms drive child through different developmental stages
* Continuous interplay between assimilation and accommodation
* Child constructs understanding through active engagement

'''

== Part 2: Piaget's Stage Theory

=== Distinction from Freudian Stage Theory

* Quite different from Freud's psychosexual stages
* Based on cognitive abilities rather than psychological conflicts

=== Research Methodology

*Piaget's Methods:*

* Ask children to solve problems
* Ask them questions
* Observe how they solve problems differently at different ages

*Result:*

* Discoveries of age-related differences led to Stage Theory
* Different cognitive capabilities emerge at predictable ages

'''

=== Stage 1: Sensorimotor Stage (Birth to ~2 years)

*Defining Characteristics:*

* Child is purely a physical creature
* No understanding of external world in meaningful cognitive sense
* No understanding of:
** Past
** Future
** Stability
** Differentiation
* Child touches and sees but doesn't yet reason

*Major Achievement: Object Permanence*

*Definition:*

* Understanding that things continue to exist when you no longer see them

*Demonstration (Adults):*

* When looking at someone, you know they continue to exist if they duck down
* Not just perception - cognitive understanding of continued existence

*Piaget's Claim About Infants:*

* Before 6 months: Children lack object permanence
* If you hide object child likes (e.g., rattle) behind something: "it's like it's gone"
* Child genuinely thinks object has ceased to exist
* Things don't continue to exist when not looking at them

*Peek-a-Boo Interpretation:*

* Why babies are surprised by peek-a-boo
* Sequence from baby's perspective:
** See adult face
** Adult covers face
** Baby: "He's gone" (literally ceased to exist)
** Adult uncovers face: "He's back!" (literally came into existence)
** Repeat cycle
* Each disappearance/reappearance is genuine for the baby

'''

=== A-not-B Task (Changing Hiding Places Problem)

*Setup:*

* Test with 9-month-old (just starting to understand object permanence)
* Hide object in cup at location A where child can't see it
* Child successfully reaches for it at location A
* Repeat multiple times - child continues reaching successfully at A

*Critical Test:*

* Move object to location B (while child watches)
* Child still reaches for location A

*Piaget's Interpretation:*

* Children not smart enough to track object movement
* Don't understand that object is no longer at A
* Further evidence they don't understand objects fully
* Understanding of objects takes considerable time and learning to develop

'''

=== Stage 2: Preoperational Stage (~2-7 years)

*Transition:*

* Child grasps world initially only in physical/sensorimotor way
* In preoperational period: Capacity to represent world mentally emerges
* Can have "world inside your head"

*BUT: Significant Limitations:*

*1. Egocentrism*

*Common English Meaning:*

* Being selfish

*Piaget's Technical Meaning:*

* Children literally cannot understand that others see world differently from them
* Not moral failing - cognitive limitation

*Three Mountains Task:*

* Setup:
** Three mountains positioned on table
** Child sits on one side
** Asked to draw what they see - 4-5 year olds can do this easily
** Then asked to draw how mountains would appear from other side
* Result: Children find this extraordinarily difficult
* Interpretation: Very difficult to grasp world as another person might see it

'''

*2. Conservation Problems*

*Definition of Conservation:*

* Ways to transform things such that some aspects change but others remain the same
* Certain properties are conserved through transformation

*Examples:*

*Liquid Conservation:*

* Pour glass of water into different shaped glass (shallow or tall)
* Amount of water doesn't change
* But according to Piaget, children don't know this

*Number Conservation:*

* Take bunch of pennies and spread them out
* Don't get more pennies by spreading
* But children don't understand this

*Classic Demonstration - Two Rows of Checkers:*

*Procedure:*

. Present two rows of checkers aligned one-to-one
. Ask child which has more
. Child correctly says they're the same
. Experimenter spreads out one row (same number of items, just more spaced)
. Ask again which has more
. Child now says the spread-out row has more

*Significance:*

* "Really stupid" but robust finding
* Replicates across children
* Suggests fundamental limitation in understanding transformations

*Practical Application:*

* Anyone with access to 4-5 year old can replicate this
* Simple demonstration of cognitive stage

'''

=== Stage 3: Concrete Operations (7-12 years)

*Achievements:*

* CAN solve conservation problems
* Understand physical transformations preserve quantity

*Limitations:*

* Still limited in capacity for abstract reasoning
* Stuck to some extent in concrete world

*Examples of What's Beyond Them:*

* Mathematical notions: Infinity
* Logical notions: Logical entailment
* Abstract theoretical concepts

*Summary:*

* Can do a lot
* But abstract, theoretical thinking not yet fully developed

'''

=== Stage 4: Formal Operations (~12+ years)

*Capabilities:*

* Abstract reasoning emerges
* Scientific reasoning possible
* Can think hypothetically
* Can reason about abstract concepts

*Full Cognitive Maturity:*

* Able to engage in adult-level abstract thought

'''

== Part 3: Evaluation of Piaget's Theory

=== Why Piaget Fared Better Than Freud or Skinner

*1. Falsifiable Claims:*

* Interesting and testable claims about child development
* Claims about conservation failures at different ages easily tested
* Systematically testable predictions
* Lot of empirical support

*2. Rich Theoretical Framework:*

* Pulled together many observations in coherent way
* Wrote many books and articles
* Very well articulated theory
* Comprehensive explanatory system

*3. Striking Findings:*

* Conservation findings: Nobody noticed before Piaget
* Object permanence problems: Previously unknown
* Revealed hidden aspects of child cognition
* Discoveries that were both surprising and replicable

'''

=== Limitations of Piaget's Theory

*1. Theoretical Limitations:*

*Explanatory Gaps:*

* Interesting question: Does he really EXPLAIN transitions?
** How does child go from concrete thinker to abstract thinker?
** How does child go from lacking object permanence to having it?
* Describes stages well
* But mechanism of transition less clear

'''

*2. Methodological Limitations:*

*Primary Method: Question and Answer:*

* Heavy reliance on verbal responses from children

*Problem:*

* Children aren't very good with language
* Might lead to underestimating what they actually know
* Particularly problematic the younger the child

*General Principle:*

* Performance may not reflect competence
* Verbal limitations may mask underlying knowledge

'''

*3. Importance of Methodology in Science*

*General Principle:*

* Often 90% of science is discovering clever method to test hypotheses
* Methodology is crucial in psychology

*Example from Different Domain: Tickling Research:*

*Research Questions:*

* When do people laugh when tickled?
* Where do you have to tickle?
* Can you tickle yourself?
* Does it have to be surprise?

*Methodological Challenge:*

* Very difficult to study in lab
* Can't just have graduate student tickle participants
* Social dynamics interfere with natural response

*Henry Gleitman's Solution:*

* Built a "tickle machine"
* Box with two giant hands that went "r-r-r-r"

*Result:*

* Complete failure
* People couldn't go near machine without convulsing in laughter
* Anticipation destroyed natural response

*Point:*

* Sometimes clever methodology fails
* Sometimes methodology itself creates problems
* Need to match method to question

'''

*4. Factual Limitations:*

*Central Question:*

* What do infants and children REALLY know?

*Possibility:*

* Due to methodological limitations, Piaget systematically underestimated children's and babies' knowledge
* Reliance on verbal responses and motor responses may have missed cognitive capabilities

*Evidence:*

* Modern research suggests this is indeed the case
* Babies know more than Piaget thought

'''

== Part 4: Modern Science of Infant Cognition

=== Historical Context and Consensus View

*Long-Standing View:*

* Tremendous philosophical and psychological consensus
* Babies are essentially stupid
* Babies don't know much about the world

*The Onion Headline:*

* Satirizes common view: "New Study Reveals Babies Are Stupid"
* Captures traditional assumption about infant cognition

*Recent Research:*

* Challenges this consensus
* Suggests babies might be smarter than traditionally thought
* But requires clever methods to discover this intelligence

'''

=== The Challenge of Studying Babies

*Fundamental Problem:*

* Can't ask questions - babies can't talk
* Could look at behavior but babies aren't well-coordinated or skilled
* Need clever, indirect methods

'''

=== Method 1: Brain Waves

*Technique:*

* Measure electrical activity in brain
* Use electrodes on scalp

*Example Image:*

* Child with electrodes
* (Joke about child dying - obviously didn't happen)
* Shows feasibility of method

*Limitations:*

* Expensive equipment
* Difficult to interpret
* Limited information about specific cognitive content

'''

=== Method 2: Pacifier Sucking

*Basic Capability:*

* One thing babies CAN do consistently: suck on pacifier

*Question:*

* How could you learn anything from sucking?

*Answer:*

* Build machines that respond to sucking
* When baby sucks, they hear music or language
* Measure how much they suck to determine preferences
* Sucking rate indicates interest/preference

*Applications:*

* Studying auditory preferences
* Language discrimination
* Musical preferences

'''

=== Method 3: Looking Times (Most Important Method)

*Primary Researcher:*

* Elizabeth Spelke (developmental psychologist)
* Pioneered most research using looking times
* Developed sophisticated paradigms

*Basic Principle:*

* Babies CAN look
* Can control eye movements
* Duration and direction of looking reveals cognitive processing

'''

=== Two Looking-Time Paradigms

*Paradigm 1: Preference*

*Logic:*

* If baby looks longer at X than Y, baby prefers X

*Example Applications:*

*1. Dogs vs. Cats:*

* Show picture of dog on one side
* Show picture of cat on other side
* Measure which one baby looks at longer
* Reveals preference

*2. Pretty Faces vs. Ugly Faces:*

* Put pretty face on one side
* Put ugly face on other side
* See if baby prefers to look at pretty one
* Tests aesthetic preferences

'''

*Paradigm 2: Habituation and Surprise*

*Key Concept:*

* Habituation = fancy word for boredom

*Procedure:*

. Show baby something over and over again
. Baby learns it's not very interesting (habituation from behaviorism)
. Show baby something different
. If baby sees it AS different, baby will look longer

*Measurement:*

* Increased looking time = detection of difference
* No increase in looking = baby sees stimuli as same

*Example Application: Color Vision*

*Question:*

* Can babies tell green from red?

*Procedure:*

. Show green patch repeatedly
. Baby habituates (gets bored)
. Show red patch

*If they look the same to baby:*

* Baby continues to tune out
* No increase in looking time

*If red looks different:*

* Baby perks up
* Increased looking time

*Result:*

* This IS how researchers study color vision in babies

'''

=== Surprise Paradigm (Related to Habituation)

*Principle:*

* Show babies something that shouldn't happen
* If babies also think it shouldn't happen, they'll look longer

*Method:*

* Essentially scientists do magic tricks
* Violate expected physical or social rules
* Measure surprise through looking time

'''

== Part 5: Object Permanence Research - Challenging Piaget

=== The Central Question

* Is it really true babies don't know objects remain when out of sight?
* Piaget said yes - modern research says no

'''

=== Study 1: Spelke and Baillargeon - Occluded Bar

*Display:*

* Block positioned in center
* Bar moves back and forth
* Bar visible on top of block and below block
* Middle section (behind block) is occluded

*Adult Perception:*

* Obvious assumption: There's a complete bar
* Never see middle section but assume it's there
* Understand object continues behind occluder

*Alternative (Simpler) Perception:*

* Could just see: bar on top + bar on bottom
* Two separate objects
* Wouldn't expect anything in middle (never saw it)

*Test:*

* Habituate babies to this display
* Then show either:
** *Display B:* Complete bar (expected)
** *Display C:* Broken bar (unexpected if assume object continuity)

*Results:*

* Adults expect B; C is almost a joke
* Babies respond SAME WAY as adults
* Babies expect complete bar
* Surprised by (look longer at) broken bar

*Interpretation:*

* Even young babies understand objects continue behind occluders
* Have concept of object permanence
* Contradicts Piaget's claims

'''

=== Study 2: Baillargeon - Drawbridge and Block

*Test Age:*

* Six-month-olds

*Setup:*

* Stage with block on it
* Screen rises and obscures block

*Two Possibilities:*

*If babies expect block to still be there:*

* Should think screen will be stopped by block
* Screen can't pass through solid object

*If "out of sight, out of mind" (Piaget's view):*

* Should expect screen to keep going
* Object no longer exists, so nothing to stop screen

*Procedure:*

* Create two displays:
** *Possible event:* Screen stops at block (block stops screen)
** *Impossible event:* Remove block with trap door; screen continues full rotation

*Results:*

* Baby "screams" (figurative - actually just looks longer)
* Babies surprised by impossible event
* Look longer at screen passing through where block should be

*Interpretation:*

* Babies expect object to remain
* Understand solid objects should impede screen
* Have object permanence

'''

=== Study 3: Karen Wynn - Arithmetic and Object Permanence

*Research Location:*

* Yale University, Karen Wynn's lab

*Methods:*

* Real objects in some studies
* Animated versions in others

*Animated Example:*

* Baby sees: 1 object → +1 object added → occluder
* Expected result: 2 objects
* Baby then sees result:
** 2 objects: Expected (no surprise)
** 1 object: Unexpected (surprise - baby looks longer)
** 3 objects: Unexpected (surprise - baby looks longer)
** 0 objects: Unexpected (surprise - baby looks longer)

*Test:*

* 2 - 1 = ?
* Babies expect: 1
* When 2 - 1 = 2 or 3 or 0: Babies look longer (surprise)

*Age:*

* Even six-month-olds sensitive to these rudimentary arithmetic facts

*Implications:*

. Tells us about mathematical knowledge
. Tells us babies expect things to remain when out of sight
. Have object permanence much earlier than Piaget claimed

'''

== Part 6: Limits of Infant Physical Knowledge

=== Important Caveat

* Infants' understanding of physical world present from very start
* BUT not entirely complete
* Certain things babies DON'T know

'''

=== Gravity Understanding: Developmental Progression

*Study: Floating Block*

*Display:*

* Block positioned mid-air with no support
* Clearly violates gravity

*6-Month-Olds:*

* Find this surprising
* Understand objects can't float in mid-air
* Basic gravity concept present

'''

*Display: Block Partially Supported*

* Block with small portion resting on surface
* Most of block extends over edge unsupported

*6-Month-Olds:*

* Don't find this surprising
* Not smart enough to know this should fall
* Don't understand center of gravity/support requirements

*12-Month-Olds:*

* DO think it should fall
* Understand need for adequate support

'''

*Display: Top-Heavy Configuration*

* Object balanced but unstable
* Should tip over

*12-Month-Olds:*

* Don't find anything weird about this
* Don't understand instability

*Adults:*

* Sophisticated enough to understand unstable configuration
* Know it should fall over

'''

=== General Principle

*Conclusion:*

* Some things are built in (basic object continuity, simple physics)
* Some things develop over time (gravity details, stability)
* Raises question: How do we explain development?

'''

== Part 7: Mechanisms of Development

=== Mechanism 1: Neural Maturation - Growth of Brain

*Neuron Count:*

* Most neurons you have now in your head were present in mother's uterus
* Don't generate massive numbers of new neurons through development

*What DOES Happen in Development:*

*Primary Process: Pruning*

* Getting rid of neurons
* Neural structures change radically
* Babies eliminate excess neurons through development

*Synaptic Growth:*

* While pruning neurons, connections between neurons grow extensively
* "Connections grow like crazy"
* Process of synaptic growth: Connections across different synapses
* Peaks at approximately 2 years of age

*Myelination:*

* Fatty sheath develops over neurons
* Makes neurons more effective at transmission
* Continues through development
* Even teenagers not fully myelinated
* Particularly: Not fully myelinated in frontal lobes

*Frontal Lobe Functions:*

* Involved in restraint
* Involved in willpower
* Executive function

*Implication:*

* Problem might be: Baby's brain doesn't develop certain capacities yet
* Physical maturation of brain limits cognitive capabilities

'''

=== Mechanism 2: Problems with Inhibition

*Relationship to Brain Development:*

* Related to frontal lobe development
* Comes out clearly in A-not-B error

*A-not-B Error Revisited:*

* Baby reaches at A repeatedly
* Object moved to B
* Baby continues reaching at A

*Two Possible Explanations:*

*Piaget's Explanation:*

* Babies don't know anything about objects
* Lack understanding of object permanence

*Alternative Explanation:*

* Once you do something, it's hard to stop
* Takes cognitive control to inhibit prepotent response
* Babies lack this control

*Supporting Evidence:*

* Independent evidence that babies lack inhibitory control
* Part of brain controlling certain behaviors not active yet

'''

=== Simpson's Illustration of Inhibition

*Homer's Task:*

* Does behavior A repeatedly
* Stimulus moved
* Continues doing A (can't inhibit learned response)
* "D'oh!" - realizes mistake but can't stop

*Application to Development:*

* May sum up much of developmental differences
* Child does A, A, A
* It's moved
* Child continues reaching for A despite seeing movement

*Adele Diamond's Research:*

* Kids reach for A (where object was)
* But LOOK at B (where object is)
* Suggests: They KNOW it's at B
* But can't stop themselves from reaching to A
* Knowledge present; inhibitory control absent

'''

=== Mechanism 3: Learning - Some Things You Have to Learn

*Domains of Learning:*

* Social world
* Economic world
* Political world
* Physical world

*Even Adults Don't Know Everything:*

'''

=== McCloskey Study: College Students and Physics

*Setup:*

* Hollow tube at top
* Ball thrown through tube
* Ball whips through and exits

*Question:*

* What path does ball take after exiting?
* Path A: Straight line (correct)
* Path B: Curved path (incorrect)

*Results at Yale:*

* Everybody gets it right

*Results at Johns Hopkins:*

* 50/50 split between A and B
* Systematic biases
* Incorrect physical intuitions

*Twist - Water Version:*

* Ask: "What if you squirted water through tube?"
* Nobody chooses B (curved path)
* Everybody knows water continues in straight line

*Interpretation:*

* When you have experience: Helps you out
* Absence of experience: Kind of lost
* Some physical knowledge requires learning from experience
* Not all intuitions about physics are innate

'''

== Part 8: Babies in the Social World

=== Early Social Preferences

*Research Challenges:*

* Very hard to do research with newborns
* Consent procedures
* Logistical difficulties

*Solution (Humorous):*

* "Most work done in France where they have no laws at all"
* "Rush in when women give birth: 'We are psychologists!'"
* "Do experiments on babies - it's terrific"

'''

=== Face Preference Study

*Stimuli:*

* Face-like pattern
* Scrambled facial features

*Results:*

* Newborns prefer face-like pattern
* Look longer at organized face

*Interpretation:*

* Preference for faces in humans and other primates
* Some innate face detection/preference

'''

=== Social Imitation

*Andrew Meltzoff's Research:*

*Advice:*

* "First thing you should do" with newborn baby
* Stick face right up to baby
* Stick your tongue out

*Results:*

* Babies more often than not stick tongues out back
* Suggests social connection between people
* Early form of imitation

*Later Development:*

* Babies become more sophisticated mimics
* Will copy facial expressions of person next to them

'''

=== Debates About Early Social Responses

*Questions:*

* Nature of face preference
* Nature of mimicry responses
* How "smart" are these behaviors?

*Current Status:*

* Matter of debate
* Lot of ongoing research
* Can we use physical world methods for social world?

'''

== Part 9: Social Cognition Research - Helping and Hindering Study

=== Researchers

* Paul Bloom (lecturer)
* Valerie Kuhlmeier
* Karen Wynn

=== Participants

* 9-month-olds
* 12-month-olds

'''

=== Experimental Design

*Setup:*

* Babies watch movies
* One character helps a ball achieve goal
* Another character hinders the ball

*Research Question:*

* Will babies expect ball to approach helper vs. hinderer?

*Methodology:*

* Babies see literal movie used in experiment
* Extensive controls:
** Square in one movie → triangle in another
** Top position in one movie → bottom in another
** Counterbalancing across conditions

'''

=== Movie Content (Example)

* Ball attempts to go up hill
* One character (helper) pushes ball up
* Other character (hinderer) pushes ball down
* Repeated multiple times

'''

=== Test Phase

*Question:*

* Does baby expect ball to approach helper or hinderer?

*Results:*

* Statistically: Babies look longer when ball approaches hinderer
* Look less (expected event) when ball approaches helper

*Interpretation:*

* Babies have social interpretation of events
* See movie in terms of helping and hindering
* Understand social valence of actions
* Expect approach to helper, not hinderer

'''

=== Follow-Up Research: Kiley Hamlin

*Extended Prediction:*

* If babies understand helping/hindering
* Babies should themselves prefer helper over hinderer

*Method:*

* Show babies three-dimensional scenes (not just movies)
* Present actual character objects
* See which one baby reaches for

*Methodological Detail:*

* Person offering choice is BLIND to study
* "Blind" = technical term
* Experimenter has no idea what baby saw
* Point: Avoid intentional or unintentional influence
* Can't bias result because doesn't know correct answer

'''

=== Video Example

* Baby watches helping/hindering scene
* Experimenter (blind to condition) offers two characters
* Baby reaches for one

*Evidence:*

* Suggests some social understanding may be present from very start
* Tentative evidence
* Very controversial

'''

== Part 10: Developmental Puzzle - Children's Social Limitations

=== The Paradox

* Babies show some social understanding (helping/hindering studies)
* BUT young children are very clueless about people in other ways
* Not just babies - young children (3-4 years old)

'''

=== Study 1: Deceptive Dolls Study

*Setup:*

* Two dolls with different sized shoes
* One doll: Big shoes
* Other doll: Little shoes
* Food gets stolen

*Actual Thief:*

* Doll with little shoes stole food

*Deception:*

* Big shoes placed at scene
* Mother will see big shoes
* Should think doll with big shoes stole food

*Question to Child:*

* "Who will mother think stole the food?"

*Correct Answer:*

* Mother will think doll with big shoes did it (based on evidence)

*Children's Response:*

* Point to doll with little shoes
* Answer who REALLY stole food
* Don't understand mother will have false belief based on misleading evidence

'''

=== Study 2: Mean Monkey Study

*Setup:*

* Child wants stickers
* Two types available (e.g., rocket ships, other design)
* Mean monkey present

*Rules:*

* Child points to which stickers they want
* Mean monkey will take whatever child points to
* Child gets the OTHER stickers

*Correct Strategy:*

* Point to stickers you DON'T want
* Mean monkey takes those
* You get the ones you DO want

*Results:*

* Young children repeatedly fail
* Keep pointing to stickers they want
* Mean monkey keeps taking them
* Child gets undesired stickers
* Doesn't learn to point to other option

'''

=== Age Pattern

*Failure:*

* Three-year-olds fail
* Young four-year-olds tend to fail

*Success:*

* Around age 4-5, children succeed
* Period around 4, 4.5 years: Transition from failure to success

'''

== Part 11: Explaining Children's Social Limitations

=== Two Competing Theories

*Theory 1: Knowledge Deficit (Psychologist's Interpretation)*

*Position:*

* Children need to know more about minds
* Don't understand intent to deceive
* Don't comprehend that someone could choose maliciously
* Lack theory of mind

*For Deceptive Dolls:*

* Don't understand mother will form belief based on evidence
* Can't represent false beliefs

*For Mean Monkey:*

* Don't understand strategic deception
* Can't plan to point to non-preferred option

*Status:*

* This is possible
* One respectable theory

'''

*Theory 2: Inhibition Problems (Alternative)*

*Position:*

* Children have right knowledge
* Suffer from problems with inhibition
* Can't suppress prepotent responses

*For Deceptive Dolls:*

* Task is "fairly difficult"
* Children might get overwhelmed
* When asked "who would mother think?" they respond with who REALLY did it
* Some pull toward correct answer makes task difficult
* Can't inhibit knowledge of true state

*For Mean Monkey:*

* Boy clearly wanted rocket ship stickers
* When asked to point to what he wants
* Just couldn't help but point to what he wanted
* Extra work required to lie was beyond him
* Inhibiting true desire too difficult

'''

=== Evidence for Inhibition Theory

*Even Adults Find These Tasks Difficult:*

* Slower at tasks involving lying and deception
* Make more mistakes on deception tasks
* Compared to tasks not involving lying/deception

*Implication:*

* Not just developmental limitation
* Deception and strategic lying cognitively demanding even for adults
* Suggests inhibition component, not just knowledge deficit

'''

=== Status of Debate

*Unresolved:*

* Not attempting to solve problem in this lecture
* Raised as interesting area of debate
* More coverage in:
** Peter Gray textbook
** Norton readings on development

'''

== Part 12: Modularity vs. General Development

=== Two Theoretical Positions

*Piaget's Position (and Freud's):*

* General, across-the-board changes in how children think
* Single developmental trajectory
* Unified cognitive development

*Alternative: Modular View*

*Developers:*

* Noam Chomsky
* Jerry Fodor (philosopher of mind)

*Core Claim:*

* Idea of child developing as single story is mistaken
* Instead: Separate pre-wired systems for reasoning about world

*Characteristics of Modules:*

* Separate systems for different domains
* Each system has some built-in knowledge
* Each must do some learning
* Learning pattern varies from system to system
* Separateness/independence between modules

'''

=== Evidence for Modularity: Developmental Disorders

*Key Principle:*

* If truly separate systems, should be able to damage one without damaging others
* Selective impairment supports modularity

'''

=== Case Study: Autism

*Personal Note from Lecturer:*

* Why entered psychology
* Started working with autistic children
* Always found autism fascinating

*Theoretical Significance:*

* Striking illustration of how social part of brain is distinct from other brain parts
* Social module can be damaged while other modules intact

'''

=== Autism: Basic Facts

*Prevalence:*

* Strikes approximately 1 in 1000 people
* Mostly boys (significant gender difference)

*Dominant Problems:*

* Lack of social connectedness
* Problems with language
* Problems dealing with people

*Simon Baron-Cohen's Term:*

* "Mind blindness"

*Pattern of Impairments:*

* NO impairments dealing with physical world
* NO necessary impairments on:
** Mathematical skills
** Spatial skills
* But: Lot of problems with people

'''

=== Autism: Range of Severity

*Severe:*

* Many autistic children have no language
* Totally shut off from society

*Higher Functioning:*

* Some learn language
* Manage some sort of independent life
* Nevertheless suffer from severe social impairment

'''

=== Experimental Demonstrations of Social Impairment

*Study 1: Simon Baron-Cohen - Chocolate Choice Task*

*Setup:*

* Show 3-4 year olds picture
* Four chocolates arranged in row
* Character "Charlie" in middle
* Charlie looking at one particular chocolate

*Question:*

* "Which chocolate will Charlie take?"

*Typical Children's Response:*

* Answer is "pretty clear"
* The one Charlie's looking at
* Obvious that people's interests align with gaze direction

*Autistic Children's Response:*

* Often just shrug
* Say "How could I know?"
* Don't instinctively appreciate that:
** People's interests tend to align with where they're looking
** Gaze direction indicates desire/intention

'''

=== Study 2: False Belief Task (Sally-Anne Task)

*Frequency:*

* Done hundreds, perhaps thousands of times
* Classic developmental psychology task

*Setup:*

. Doll named Maxie puts ball in cupboard
. Maxie leaves
. Second doll enters
. Second doll takes ball out of cupboard
. Second doll puts ball under bed
. Maxie returns

*Question:*

* "Where will Maxie look for the ball?"

*Two Types of Questions:*

*Physical World Question:*

* "Where IS the ball really?"
* Answer: Under the bed
* Everyone can solve this

*Mental World Question:*

* "Where will Maxie LOOK for the ball?"
* This is hard

*Correct Answer:*

* Maxie will look in cupboard
* Even though ball not really there
* Because Maxie has false belief about world
* Maxie doesn't know ball was moved

'''

=== Developmental Pattern for False Belief

*2-3 Year Olds:*

* Find this difficult
* Fail the task

*4-5 Year Olds:*

* Able to pass task
* Understand false beliefs

*Normal Adults:*

* Able to pass task easily

*Autistic Individuals:*

* Have serious problems
* Often people with autism who are otherwise very high functioning will fail
* Will say "He'll check under the bed"
* Can't represent that someone else has different (false) belief

'''

== Part 13: Questions About Autism

=== Question 1: Relationship Between Deception Task and False Belief Task

*Student Question:*

* How do deception task (shoes) and false belief task relate?

*Answer:*

* Both designed to tap appreciation of false belief
* Deception task: More complex
** Can you understand mother might think it's one person even though it's really another?
** Tests understanding of deception causing false belief
* False belief task: Stripped-down version
** Without "fanciness" of deception task
** Tests exactly same underlying concept
** Simpler, more direct test

'''

=== Question 2: Why Mostly Boys?

*Student Question:*

* Why does autism mostly affect boys?

*Lecturer's Answer:*

* "Nobody knows"
* But there's a theory that provides broader context

*Simon Baron-Cohen's Theory:*

*Claims:*

* Certain abilities more "sequestered" for males
* Other abilities more "sequestered," focused on females

*Specific Claim:*

* Social abilities tend to be more female than male

*Provocative Formulation:*

* "To be a man is to suffer from very mild form of autism"

*Autism as Extreme:*

* Autistic individuals suffer from "extreme male brains"
* Logical consequence: More sampled from male population than female

*Status:*

* Interesting, controversial theory
* Will return to when discussing sex differences
* Examine whether supported by evidence

'''

=== Question 3: Severity of Autism and Developmental Stages

*Student Question:*

* How think about severity of autism with regard to developmental stages?

*Answer:*

* Sort of surprisingly: Autism can't really be thought of that way

*Key Point:*

* NOT like adult with autism is like 3-year-old or 2-year-old
* In some ways, somebody with autism isn't like any normally developing child at all

*Not a Developmental Delay:*

* Not same as developmental delay
* Different from certain forms of intellectual disability/retardation

*BUT:*

* When assessing severity, DO look at things like language ability
* In that sense, related to development

'''

=== Question 4: Overcoming Autism

*Student Question:*

* What are chances someone with autism can overcome deficiencies?

*Answer:*

* "Autism is funny disorder"
* Lot of media publication and presentation

*Media Bias:*

* Often showcase very exceptional people
* Example: Temple Grandin
** Autistic woman
** Wrote wonderful books about experience
** But very unusual case

*Reality for Majority:*

* Answer depends on:
** How one defines autism
** Whether include Asperger syndrome (limited, more mild syndrome)
* Majority of people with autism have severe problems
* At this stage, with current therapy level:
** Will not lead normal life
** Severe, persistent impairments

'''

=== Question 5: Autistic Savants

*Student Question:*

* More specifically about Rain Man
* Are these exceptional abilities common?

*Answer:*

*Rain Man Character:*

* Played by Dustin Hoffman
* Had extraordinary mathematical abilities

*Real Phenomenon:*

* Some people with autism have:
** Extraordinary artistic abilities
** Mathematical abilities
** Musical abilities
* "Amazing question why they have it"

*Frequency:*

* Very small minority
* Very rare

*Significance:*

* Fascinating that happens at all
* Severe damage in one area
* Compensated with powerful skill in another
* But: Most people with autism do NOT have exceptional abilities

'''

== Part 14: What Are the Modules?

=== Modules Discussed So Far

*Two Primary Modules:*

. *Physics Module:*
** Understanding physical world
** Object permanence
** Physical causation
** Gravity, support

. *Social Module:*
** Understanding people
** Intentions
** Desires
** Beliefs
** Social causation

'''

=== Other Proposed Modules

*Artifacts Module:*

* Special brain module for dealing with artifacts
* Artifacts: Things like tables, chairs, cars, forks
* Human-made objects
* Distinct from natural objects

*Sociology Module:*

* Dealing with human groups
* Understanding:
** Races
** Classes
** Social hierarchies

*Intuitive Biology Module:*

* Common-sense biological understanding of world
* Separate from understanding of people
* Separate from understanding of physics

*Most Dominant Proponent:*

* Frank Keil
* Master of Morse College at Yale
* Strongly defended notion of intuitive biological module

'''

== Part 15: General vs. Specific Development

=== Beyond Modular View

*Possibility:*

* Might also be profound general differences between children and adults
* Not just specific to particular domains
* Not just:
** How you think about objects
** How you think about people
** How you think about this or that
* But rather: More general cognitive differences

'''

=== Language as General Cognitive Transformation

*Claim:*

* Very big difference between:
** Creature without language
** Creature with language

*Part of Claim:*

* Learning a language
* Learning to speak
* Reconfigures human brain in exceptional way

*Significance:*

* Really exceptional transformation
* Has no parallel in any other species

*Status:*

* Interesting claim
* Will return to next class when discussing language

'''

== Part 16: Why Study Development If You're Not Interested in Children?

=== Stephen Jay Gould's Argument

*Suppose You:*

* Hate development
* Hate developmental psychology
* Hate babies
* Hate children
* They're not cute
* They're ugly
* Don't want to have them
* Don't want to study them
* Annoyed we have to discuss them

*Fine. BUT:*

* Still reasons to study development
* Even if not interested in children per se

'''

=== Developmental Science Can Inform Questions About Adults

*Principle:*

* Sometimes developmental studies
* Developmental data
* Developmental science
* Can answer questions about adult structures and functions

'''

=== Stephen Jay Gould's Example: The Zebra Question

*Question:*

* Is zebra a black animal with white stripes?
* Or white animal with black stripes?

*Method Limitation:*

* Could look at adult zebras all day long
* Never going to figure this out from adult observation

*Solution:*

* Look at development
* Watch embryological development of zebra
* That's how you would learn answer

*Point:*

* Developmental analysis reveals structural truths
* Can't determine from adult form alone

'''

=== Final Quote: D'Arcy Thompson

*Source:*

* Famous biologist
* Wrote "On Growth and Form"

*Quote:*

* "Everything is the way it is because it got that way"

*Significance:*

* Model for many developmental psychologists
* Model for many evolutionary psychologists
* Understanding current state requires understanding developmental/historical process
