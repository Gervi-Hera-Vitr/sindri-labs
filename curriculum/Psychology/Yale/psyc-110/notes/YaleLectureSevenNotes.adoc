= Psychology Lecture Notes: Animal Communication, Perception, Attention, and Memory

== Introduction: Follow-ups from Previous Lecture

=== Follow-up 1: Language Preference Development

*Question from Student:*
- When does preference for own language emerge in development?

*Answer:*
- Studies on newborn babies
- Pretty much moment they pop out: Favor their own language over other languages
- Suggests: Listening while in utero (in the womb) to rhythms of their language
- Developing preference before birth

'''

=== Follow-up 2: "Let Him Have It" Case Resolution

*Background:*
- Court case mentioned previously
- Person said "Let him have it" when someone else pointing gun at police officer
- Police officer was killed
- Person charged with murder

*Outcome:*
- Tried and found guilty for murder
- Subsequently pardoned in 1988
- But: He was executed in 1957
- "Really nice except he was executed"
- Made into a movie

'''

== Part 1: Review of Language Lecture

=== Topics Covered Previously

*Universals of Language:*
- Properties shared across all languages

*Detailed Aspects:*
- Phonology (sounds)
- Morphology (words/morphemes)
- Syntax (grammar)

*Amazing Features:*
- Language uses arbitrary signs or sounds to convey concepts
- Languages exploit combinatorial system including recursion
- Puts together symbols into virtually limitless set of meaningful sentences

*Development:*
- Developmental time course
- Emergence of language from babies
- Babies really good at learning language
- Adults whose brains have "atrophied," whose language capacities are "dead"

'''

== Part 2: Animal Communication Systems

=== Central Questions

*Now That We Know About Language:*
- Do animals possess same sort of language?
- If not, can they learn it?

'''

=== Basic Facts About Animal Communication

*No Doubt:*
- Nonhuman animals possess communication systems
- Known forever
- Not matter of controversy

*Definitional Issue:*

*If "Language" Means "Communication":*
- Answer is obviously "yes"
- Dogs, bees, and monkeys have language

*If "Language" in Technical, Narrow Sense:*
- As anything with properties discussed earlier
- Using English, ASL, Spanish as background
- Answer's almost certainly "no"

'''

=== Three Categories of Animal Communication Systems

*Category 1: Finite List of Calls*

*Example: Vervet Monkeys*
- Small list of calls
- Convey different warnings
- "Attack from a snake"
- "Attack from a leopard"

'''

*Category 2: Continuous Analog Signal*

*Example: Bee Dance*
- Communicates location of food sources
- Doesn't do it in syntactically structured way
- Rather: Intensity of dance corresponds to richness of food source

'''

*Category 3: Random Variation on a Theme*

*Example: Birdsong*

'''

=== What Animal Communication Systems Lack

*Don't Find in Any Real Sense:*
- Phonology
- Morphology
- Syntax
- Combinatorial systems
- Arbitrary names

*Status:*
- This much is not particularly controversial

'''

== Part 3: Trained Primates - Controversial Cases

=== Famous Cases

*Examples:*
- Kanzi
- Nim Chimpsky
- Other famous primates seen on Discovery Channel and other venues

*Status:*
- Fairly controversial

'''

=== Critique of Textbook Treatment

*Gray Textbook:*
- Nothing particularly inaccurate
- But: Lecturer thinks Gray "a little bit too credulous, too believing"
- Too accepting of claims about abilities of animals

'''

=== Scientific Arguments Against Primate Language Claims

*Argument 1: Very Few Words Learned*

*If Can Be Said to Learn Words at All:*
- Learn very few of them
- Takes extensive years of training to learn
- Unlike normally developing child:
- Could learn word in a day
- Could learn word in an hour

'''

*Argument 2: Limited Order*

*Utterances:*
- Often have order
- But: Order tends to be very limited
- Lacks recursive properties
- In fact, lack of recursion is not controversial

'''

*Argument 3: Extreme Repetitiveness*

*Utterances of Trained Chimpanzees:*
- Extremely repetitive

*What You See on TV:*
- Sort of sampling
- Sampling could often be very impressive

*But If You Take Random Utterances:*
- Tends to look very different

*Typical Chimpanzee Utterances (Taken at Random):*

```
"Nim eat, Nim eat.
Drink, eat, me Nim.
Me gum, me gum.
Tickle me, Nim play.
Me eat, me eat.
Me banana, you banana, me you give.
Banana me, me eat.
Give orange, me give, eat orange, me eat orange."
```

*Lila Gleitman's Comment:*
- If any normally developing child spoke like this
- Parents would rush him screaming to neurologist

'''

=== Broader Question: Why Expect Chimps to Learn Human Language?

*General Principle:*
- We don't normally expect one species to have capacities associated with another species

*Examples:*

*Bats:*
- Use echolocation to get around
- No active research program seeing if cats can use echolocation

*Birds:*
- Navigate by stars
- No research program seeing if dogs could navigate by stars

'''

=== Bad Ideas About Language That Cause Confusion

*Bad Idea 1: Chimps Are Smart, Therefore Should Use Language*

*Response:*
- They ARE smart
- But we know that smart isn't enough

*Evidence:*
- Human capacity for language is not totally result of smartness
- There are smart children who, due to deficit in language capacity:
- Don't speak
- Don't understand language
- Smartness of chimpanzees does not in itself demonstrate they should be able to learn language

'''

*Bad Idea 2: Chimps Are Our Nearest Evolutionary Relatives*

*Correct Part:*
- This is right
- One would expect, on face of it, not unreasonable to expect us to share lot of abilities with them

*On the Other Hand:*
- We split from them long time ago
- Plainly humans are different from chimps
- Five million years either way
- That's more than enough time for language capacity to evolve

'''

=== Value of Studying Animal Communication

*None of This Is to Say:*
- Study of nonhuman communication systems isn't interesting

*Lecturer's Personal Opinion:*

*Misguided Approaches:*
- Study of attempts to teach chimpanzees, gibbons, or gorillas a human language like ASL are misguided
- Would be as if team of monkeys kidnapped human child and tried to train him how to hoot like monkey
- Might be enjoyable
- But: Does not seem to give us any rich insights

*More Interesting Approach:*
- Study of animal communication systems in the wild
- There's linguistics of human language that has delineated principles underlying all human languages
- Would be extraordinarily interesting to attempt same linguistic program to other communication systems used in wild
- Such as:
- Cries of vervet monkeys
- Bee dance

'''

== Part 4: Topics Not Covered in Language Section

=== Introduction to Omitted Topics

*Problem:*
- Intro Psych course: Have to whip through lot of topics very fast

*If You Took Course Focused Directly on Language:*
- Would learn more about various topics

'''

=== Topic 1: Language in the Brain

*Coverage:*
- Touched on very briefly in textbook
- Has large literature associated with it

'''

=== Topic 2: Language Disorders

*Examples:*
- Aphasias
- Specific language impairment
- Dyslexia

'''

=== Topic 3: Language Perception and Production

*Question:*
- How is it that we do amazing feat of understanding and producing words in fraction of second?
- Where does that ability come from?

'''

=== Topic 4: Reading

*In Many Ways Different from Language:*

*Darwin's Distinction:*
- Described language as instinct
- Carefully distinguished it from other things that don't come natural to us
- Including reading

*Facts About Reading:*
- Reading is difficult
- Reading is cultural invention
- Not every human has it
- Unlike language: Reading is acquired with tremendous difficulty over many years

*On the Other Hand:*
- Reading plainly intersects with language
- New way of conveying language
- Moving out from speech to writing
- Psychology and neuroscience of reading thus very interesting

'''

=== Topic 5: Bilingualism and Multilingualism

*Questions of Interest:*

*For People in This Room:*
- Does it matter for how well you learn language whether you're learning one, two, three, or four?
- How does multilingual encode all these different languages inside single brain?
- And so on

'''

=== Topic 6: Relationship Between Language and Thought

*Status:*
- Very hot issue
- Few years ago: Lecturer taught entire seminar called "Language and Thought" devoted to this question

*Cool Question:*
- Can break up into two very general questions

'''

#### Question 1: Is Language Necessary for Abstract Thought?

*One Way to Answer:*
- Look at creatures without language
- Like babies and chimpanzees
- See how smart they are

*Two Possible Outcomes:*

*If Very Smart:*
- Would suggest you don't need language for abstract thought

*If Certain Cognitive Limitations:*
- Would suggest language is essential for abstract thought

'''

#### Question 2: Does Language Structure Affect Thinking?

*Question:*
- Even once you know language
- Do structural properties of language you know affect way you think?

*This Claim Sometimes Described As:*
- Linguistic relativity
- Sapir-Whorf hypothesis

*Example Research:*
- Looking at speakers of different languages
- Such as English versus Korean
- Seeing whether structural differences in these languages affect how you think

*Coverage:*
- Some of this work discussed in readings
- Gray textbook
- Selections from The Norton Anthology
- Makes up reading response
- Have to address this question and take best shot at answering it

'''

== Part 5: Question and Answer on Language

=== Question 1: Individual Differences in Language Learning

*Student Question:*
- Some people learn languages easier than others
- How do we explain this?

*Answer:*

*Can Ask Question Two Ways:*

*1. First Language Learning:*
- Some children learn language very quickly
- Some are very slow

*2. Second Language Learning:*
- Some breezing through second language requirement at Yale
- Others struggling and miserable
- Considerable variation

*Einstein Story:*

*Background:*
- Very slow to learn language
- Didn't speak at all until he was four

*The Story:*
- First words: All of sudden having supper with parents
- Put down spoon
- Said: "The soup is too hot"
- Parents stared in astonishment
- Said: "You've never spoken before"
- He said: "Well, up to now everything's been fine"

*Note: It's not a true story*

*Why Differences Exist:*
- Nobody really knows
- Surprisingly hard

*Known Factors:*

*Slight Advantage for Being Female:*
- Girls slightly more advanced in language than boys
- But: Not a big one
- Need hundred people to just see it statistically

*Big Genetic Factor:*
- If your parents learned language quickly and learned other languages quickly
- You are more likely to

*Understanding of Brain Bases:*
- Brain bases of these differences
- Cognitive bases
- Social bases
- Largely open question

'''

=== Question 2: Children Exposed to Multiple Languages

*Student Question:*
- What happens when parents [speak different languages]?

*Answer:*

*Context:*
- Actually more the norm around world than situation in United States
- US: Kids exposed to single language

*What Happens:*
- Children learn both languages

*How They Do It:*
- Children very good (as adults are) at distinguishing different languages on basis of:
- Sound system
- Rhythms
- Don't typically confuse them
- Then: Just learn more than one language

*Status:*
- Actually more the average state of affairs around world

'''

=== Question 3: Hemispheric Specialization for Language

*Student Question:*
- You said people who are right-handed learn languages [in left hemisphere]

*Answer:*

*Admission:*
- Don't have much more to say than what said before
- Agrees this is deeply unsatisfying

*Right-Handed People:*
- Language probably in left side of brain

*Left-Handed People:*

*Question to Class:*
- "How many people here are left-handed?"

*For Left-Handers:*
- We don't know
- It varies
- Some: Have it in left side
- Some: Have it in right side
- Some: Kind of diffuse

*Deeper Questions:*
- Why is this?
- In fact, why are some people right-handed and others left-handed in first place?
- These are really good questions [but we don't have answers]

'''

=== Question 4: Does Learning Multiple Languages Slow Each One Down?

*Student Question:*
- Does learning more than one language cause you to learn them slower than just learning one language?

*Intuitive Reasoning:*
- Would stand to reason that it would
- There's finite amount of mental resources
- If just learning English: Use all of it for English
- If learning English and Spanish: Got to split
- Would expect each to be learned slower

*Surprising Finding:*
- Common-sense view does not appear to be true
- Children learning more than one language seem to show no deficit in each of their languages
- Relative to child learning just one language

*In Other Words:*
- If I am just learning English (kid)
- You're learning English and Spanish (kid)
- You'll reach milestones in English same time I will
- Your extra learning of Spanish doesn't seem to affect you
- Doesn't seem to be any detriment for learning multiple languages

*Related Question:*
- "Is there any cognitive deficit?"
- Some people have argued learning multiple languages sometimes harms children in certain ways
- Claim made in Quebec, for instance
- Over debate over how children should be taught English and French

*Evidence:*
- Does not appear to be case
- As far as we know: No downside to learning many languages when you're young

'''

== Part 6: Introduction to Perception, Attention, and Memory

=== Why Treat Together?

*Putting Them Together:*
- Instead of treating as separate lectures
- There's sense in which they're the same story

'''

=== The Common Story

*Example Scenario:*

*You See a Scene:*
- See this scene
- You're looking at it
- You're perceiving it
- Coming through your eyes
- You're interpreting it
- You see something
- See man and house

*If Shut Your Eyes:*
- Could still hold that scene in memory

*Week Later:*
- If asked: "What season was it?"
- You would do pretty well

*This Is the Story:*
- How we do this

'''

=== Series of Claims to Be Made

*For Perception:*
- First persuade you: Problem of perception is hard
- Successful perception involves educated and unconscious guesses about world

*For Attention:*
- We attend to some things and not others
- We miss surprising amount of what happens in world

*For Memory:*
- Many types of memory
- Key to memory is organization and understanding
- You can't trust some of your memories

'''

=== Memory Example: 9/11

*Question to Class:*
- "How many of you remember where you were at 9/11?"

*Claim:*
- Many of you are wrong
- Will never persuade you of this because you have certain memories

*Everyone Has Story:*
- Could tell story where they were when towers went down

*Clever Psychologists' Study:*

*September 12:*
- Said: "Let's do a study"
- Asked people: "Where were you yesterday when you heard the news?"
- They told them

*Later:*
- Went back to them year later, two years later
- Said: "Tell me about what happened September 11"
- They said: "I remember totally where I was. I have a very--"
- Often story was wrong

*General Pattern:*
- Lot like that which we're going to talk about

'''

=== Biggest Moral

*Central Claim (in Really Big Print):*
- We are often wrong about our experiences
- Both of the present and of right now

'''

== Part 7: Perception - The Problem Is Hard

=== Marvin Minsky Story

*Background:*
- Lecturer went to graduate school at MIT
- Story about Marvin Minsky (A.I. guru)

*Marvin Minsky:*
- If you've heard phrase "artificial intelligence" – that was him
- If you heard claim "people are nothing more than machines made of meat" – also him

*The Story:*

*Robotics Work:*
- Doing work on robotics
- Interested in building robot that could do all sorts of cool things

*Robot Requirements:*
- Had to see the world
- Had to be able to:
- Pick up things
- Recognize people
- See chairs
- Navigate its way

*Minsky's Assessment:*
- "That's tough problem"
- "Going to take graduate student whole summer to figure it out"
- Assigned it to graduate student for summer project

'''

=== Why Visual Psychologists Love This Story

*Computer Vision and Robotics Vision:*
- Attempts to make machines that can identify and recognize objects
- Has been profound failure

*Current State:*
- At this point, no machine on earth could recognize people and objects and things
- At level of really dumb one-year-old

*Reason:*
- Much harder problem than anybody could have expected

'''

=== Why Is It Such a Hard Problem?

*Naive Approach:*
- Might think it's easy problem
- "Okay, we have to figure out problem of how people see"
- "Here's what we do"
- You're over there, here's your eye
- Somehow has to get to television monitor
- Then you look at it
- That'll solve problem of how you see

*Naive Observations:*
- "Eye flips things upside down"
- "Guess this guy is going to have to get used to looking at things upside down"
- "That's an interesting problem"

*Problem with This Approach:*
- Not the way to look at it
- Doesn't answer any questions
- Just pushes question back
- Fine. How does "he" see?
- Not answering anything

'''

=== Terminator Example

*Terminator's View:*
- Has all these numbers shooting out
- Well: He has to read the numbers
- He has to see this

*Note: iTunes screenshot inadvertently shown*

'''

=== Right Way to Think About Perception

*The Eye:*
- Very ugly and bloody
- Around here: Have the retina

*The Retina:*
- Bunch of nerve cells
- Nerve cells fire for some stimulus and not others
- From array of firings: "firing... not firing... firing... not firing..."
- Have to figure out what the world is

*Better View:*
- Firings of neurons could be viewed as array of numbers
- Have to figure out how to get from numbers to:
- Objects and people
- Actions
- Events

*That's the Problem*

'''

=== The Fundamental Problem: 2D to 3D

*Made Particularly Difficult:*
- Retina is two-dimensional surface
- Have to infer 3D world from two-dimensional surface

*From Mathematical Point of View:*
- Impossible

*What This Means:*
- For any two-dimensional image
- There is indefinite number of three-dimensional images that correspond to it

*Example:*

*Suppose You Have This on Retina:*
- Array of light shaped like [certain shape]

*What Does That Correspond to in World?*
- Could correspond to thing just like that you're looking for
- Or: Could correspond to square that's tilted backwards
- Have to figure out which is which

'''

=== Solution: Unconscious Assumptions

*Way We Solve This Problem:*
- We have unconscious assumptions about how world works
- Our minds contain certain assumptions about how things should be
- Enable us to make educated guesses
- From two-dimensional array to three-dimensional world

*Note About Slides:*
- Purposefully did not make slides available for this class ahead of time
- Don't want people to cheat
- Several points where you could look at slides and confirm things lecturer says are actually true
- Want to give three examples:
1. Color
2. Objects
3. Depth

'''

== Part 8: Example 1 - Color and Brightness

=== The Basic Problem

*Question:*
- How do you tell lump of coal from snowball?

*Images Shown:*
- Lump of coal
- Snowball
- From Google images

*Initial Answer:*
- How do you know which is which?
- Lump of coal is black
- Snowball is white

*How Do You Know?*
- Maybe have on retina: Retina responds to sort of color that hits it
- Oversimplified, but assume this is true
- This is black coming out
- That's white
- That's how you tell

'''

=== Why This Can't Be Right

*Problem:*
- Objects' color is not merely matter of what material they're made of
- But: Amount of light that hits it

*Example:*
- As lecturer walks across stage
- Falls into shadow and light
- None of you screams: "Professor Bloom is changing colors!"

*What You Do:*
- Automatically factor out change in illumination as this is happening

'''

=== Demonstration: Checker Shadow Illusion

*Display:*
- See this display
- Take look at those two blocks

*Question:*
- You see this one as lighter than that one?
- You do

*Might Imagine:*
- This is because this strip is lighter than this

*But It Isn't:*
- They're the same

*Proof:*
- Won't believe until actually print it out and take look
- But: In fact the same
- Will show you

*Could Say:*
- "I'm tricking you"
- But: This is the way it works

*Close-Up:*
- Remember: Comparing this and this
- Now: Take away other parts of environment
- You'll see they're the same

*Objection:*
- "But hold it. This can't be same as this"

*Answer Goes Like This:*
- We know shadows make surfaces darker
- Don't know this like "Here's something I know"
- Rather: Know this in that it's wired up in our brains
- When we see surface in shadow: Automatically assume it's lighter than it looks
- We see it as lighter

*Can Show This:*
- By removing cues to shadow
- You see it as it really is

*Illustration:*
- Information to your eyes is just one bit of information
- Degree of light coming from single source is one bit of information
- You use to calculate certain assumptions
- Come to conclusion

'''

== Part 9: Example 2 - Objects

=== The Segmentation Problem

*Scene:*
- You see this
- Automatically and intuitively segment it into different objects
- Segment it into:
- Man
- House
- Birds
- Trees

*Question:*
- How do you do this?

*Turns Out:*
- To program computer to segment scene into different objects is hugely difficult
- Question of how we do it is, to some extent, unknown

'''

=== Gestalt Principles

*One Answer:*
- There are certain cues in environment that are signals you're dealing with different objects
- These cues often described as Gestalt principles

'''

#### Principle 1: Proximity

*Rule:*
- When you see things close to each other
- More likely than not to assume they belong to same thing

'''

#### Principle 2: Similarity

*Display:*
- Could correspond to indefinite number of objects
- But: Naturally tend to see it as two
- Do one with one texture pattern
- Other with other texture pattern

'''

#### Principle 3: Closure

*Fact:*
- This is closed square here
- Suggests it's single object

'''

#### Principle 4: Good Continuation

*Could Judge:*
- Could just as well be two shapes:
- One that runs from A to C
- Other one that runs from D to B

*But Don't Tend to See It That Way:*
- Rather: Tend to see it as:
- One that runs from A to B
- Other one that runs from C to D

'''

#### Principle 5: Common Movement

*Rule:*
- If things move together
- They're single object

'''

#### Principle 6: Good Form

*Example:*
- You see object over there
- In absence of any other information
- Might be tempted to say: That's single thing, plus sign maybe

*Versus:*
- This [different shape]
- Because has lousy form
- More tempted to say: It's two things, one thing lying on top of each other

'''

=== Nature of These Cues

*Characteristics:*
- These are sort of cues, expectations
- None of them are right
- Cases where they could all fool you

*But:*
- Useful cues that guide our parceling of world
- Our segmenting of world into distinct objects

'''

=== When Cues Fool You

*Illusory Triangle:*
- Might think, if you're suggestible
- There is triangle here
- Case where certain cues driving you to think there's triangle here
- However: No triangle here
- If you cover up these little Pacmen
- Triangle goes away

*Illusory Square:*
- Similarly: No square in middle
- No square
- "It's very Matrix"
- These are illusions
- Because these are cues that there should be square there
- The regularity of form

'''

== Part 10: Example 3 - Depth

=== The Depth Perception Problem

*What You See:*
- See this
- Don't--See it on one level as flat thing
- Another level: You look inside picture
- See, for instance: Man is in front of house

*You Look at Lecturer:*
- See podium
- If have terrible neurological disorder:
- See strange creature that's half podium
- Leading on to chest
- Up to head
- Top of him is wiggling
- Podium staying still

*If Neurologically Normal:*
- See man walking back and forth behind podium

'''

=== Why This Is Really a Problem

*Technical Reason:*
- Vision is hard

*Crudely:*
- Got two-dimensional retina
- Have to figure out three-dimensional world
- How do you do it?

*Answer Once Again:*
- Assumptions or cues
- Certain assumptions visual system makes
- Aren't always right
- In fact: In cases of visual illusions, can be wrong
- But: Will guide you to perceive world in correct and accurate way

'''

=== Depth Cues

#### Cue 1: Binocular Disparity

*Interesting One:*
- Only depth cue that involves two eyes

*How It Works:*
- If look at you pretty close
- Image get here and image get here are somewhat different
- Or: Have to focus eyes together to get same image
- If look at you in back
- They're almost identical
- Because: Further away, given two eyes that are static, closer images look

*Mechanism:*
- Not that you say to yourself: "Oh. Back there an orange. Same image in right eye and left eye. You must be far away"
- Rather: Unconsciously and automatically make estimations
- On how far people are in depth
- Based on binocular disparity

'''

#### Cue 2: Interposition

*Question:*
- How do you know lecturer is in front of podium and podium's not in front of lecturer?
- [Humorous aside: "From where I'm standing it's right"]
- How do you know podium is in front of lecturer?

*Answer:*
- Because lecturer walking here
- Then it cuts into him
- Unless going through grotesque metamorphosis
- What's happening: Makes sense to say moving behind podium
- Interposition

*Example with Guy and House:*
- How do you know guy standing in front of house?
- Because: You see all of him
- He's blocking lot of house

'''

#### Cue 3: Relative Size

*Question:*
- How far away am I?

*If Had to Estimate:*
- Part of way you'll figure that out
- You know how tall human's supposed to be

*Counterfactual:*
- If you thought lecturer was fifty feet tall
- Would assume lecturer is further away than he is

*General Principle:*
- Your judgments on size dictate your judgments about distance

*Usually:*
- This cue isn't necessary

*But:*
- If you look at Empire State Building
- If you go into field and see tower
- Your judgment of how far away tower's going to be
- Depends on your knowledge of how tall tower should be
- If it's this tall: You say "Oh, it must be--"
- Then you'd be surprised

'''

#### Cue 4: Texture Gradient

*Will Explain:*

*Remember Problem:*
- How do you know if that thing is this object or object in and of itself?

*Answer:*
- Things with textures will show themselves
- Because textures will get smaller from distance

*Logically:*
- Could still be single thing standing upright
- With just dots going up smaller

*Natural Assumption:*
- Reason why dots recede in this regular fashion
- Is because it's receding in depth

'''

#### Cue 5: Linear Perspective

*Rule:*
- Parallel lines tend to recede in distance

'''

=== Classic Illusions

#### Mueller-Lyer Illusion

*Perception:*
- People will see this as longer than this
- It's not

*Proof:*
- If don't believe: Print it out and measure it

'''

#### Ponzo Illusion

*Perception:*
- People see this one as longer than this
- Again: It's not
- Get illusions named after you when you discover these

'''

=== Explanation of Illusions

*Mueller-Lyer:*

*What's Going On:*
- Top line looks longer even though it isn't

*Explanation:*
- These other lines in scene cause visual system to make guesses about distance
- Then you correct for distance by making assumptions about size

*General Principle:*
- If have two lines
- Take up same amount of space on retina
- But you believe one is 100 feet away and other's 50 feet away
- The one that's 100 feet away: You will see as bigger
- Because brain says: "Well, if it takes up just this much space but it's further away, it must be bigger than something that's closer and takes up that much space"

*That's What Goes On:*
- For top line, for Mueller-Lyer illusion
- We assume this is further away
- This is closer
- Based on cues to distance
- Cue is factored in
- Because we assume this is further away
- We assume it must be bigger to take up same space as this which is closer

*Ponzo Illusion:*
- Linear perspective
- Parallel lines tend to recede in distance
- If this top one is further away than this
- But they take up same size in your eye
- This one must be bigger
- You see it as bigger

*Book Offers More Details:*
- On how these illusions work

'''

=== Final Illusion: Shepard Tables

*Developer:*
- Roger Shepard

*Description:*
- Called Shepard tables
- Look like two tables

*Question:*
- "Which of these tables would be easier to get through door if you have thin door?"

*People's Response:*
- Would say one on left
- This one looks sort of thicker and harder to get through
- This one looks longer and leaner

*Fact:*
- They're same size

*What This Means:*
- This [one dimension] is exactly same as this [other dimension]

'''

*Proof:*

*Demonstration:*
- Took lecturer about seven hours to do on computer
- Nobody's going to believe because could have faked it
- But: Can print it out and do yourself
- Take piece of paper, put on here
- Then move it
- Same

*Reaction:*
- Showed it to somebody
- They called lecturer a liar

*Can Do Yourself:*
- In privacy of own home or study

*But What Lecturer Really Wants:*
- After you do it, say: "Okay. Fine. Why does this one look longer and thinner than this one?"
- Answer is same answer that will explain:
- Mueller-Lyer illusion
- Ponzo illusion
- Having to do with:
- Cues to depth
- Way your mind corrects perception of depth

'''

== Part 11: Attention and Memory - Introduction

=== Why Treat Together

*We Are Fascinated with Memory:*
- Particularly interesting when memory goes wrong
- Particularly fascinating what happens in cases of amnesia

'''

=== Amnesia Demonstration

*Needs Volunteer:*
- Willing to do little bit of acting

*Scenario 1:*

*Lecturer:*
- "Pretend you have amnesia. What's your name?"

*Student:*
- "I don't know"

*Lecturer's Response:*
- "Perfect. Glad you said that"
- "That's wrong answer"
- "Because you don't have total amnesia"
- "You still remember English"

'''

*Scenario 2:*

*Second Volunteer:*

*Lecturer:*
- "What's your name?"

*Observation:*
- Looks puzzled
- But still maintains bowel and bladder control
- So hasn't forgotten everything

*Point:*
- "I always lose the third volunteer in that demo"

'''

=== Memory Is Hugely Broad Concept

*What's Included:*

*Autobiographical Memory:*
- What we standardly think

*Perfectly Rational Response:*
- When say somebody's losing their memory
- "Oh, I have movie about somebody losing their memory"
- Don't imagine person in diapers
- Imagine person:
- Walking around
- Having sex with cool people
- Saying "Where am I?"

*What You Imagine:*
- Losing autobiographical memory
- Sense of self

*But of Course:*
- Knowing English is part of your memory
- Knowing how to stand
- Knowing how to chew and swallow
- All things you've learned
- That have been molded by experience

'''

== Part 12: Types of Amnesia

=== Two Broad Types

*Often Run Together:*

*Type 1: Retrograde Amnesia*
- Lose memory of past
- "The Matt Damon amnesia"

*Type 2: Anterograde Amnesia*
- Lose ability to form new memories

'''

=== Case Study: Man Who Can't Form New Memories

*Film of Man with This Problem:*

*Background:*
- World-renowned choir director
- Suffered viral encephalitis
- Led to brain damage
- Destroyed:
- Most of temporal lobes
- Hippocampus
- Lot of left frontal lobe

*Could Have Been Worse:*
- Retains ability to talk
- Not intellectually impaired

*The Problem:*
- Just can't form new memories
- Lives in perpetual "now"
- Nothing affects him
- Feels continually reborn at every moment

*Note:*
- Not always happens like this
- More than one of these cases
- Doesn't always happen like this

'''

== Part 13: Basic Distinctions in Memory

=== Three Main Types

*Crudely:*
- Can make distinction between:
1. Sensory memory
2. Short-term memory (also known as working memory)
3. Long-term memory

'''

=== Sensory Memory

*Definition:*
- Residue in your senses

*Example:*
- Flash of lightning
- Might see afterimage
- That afterimage is your sensory memory

*Echoic Memory:*
- Somewhat longer echoic memory for sounds
- As somebody talking to you
- Even if not paying attention
- Will store few seconds of what they're saying

*Practical Application:*
- Sometimes: Somebody talking to you
- You're not listening
- They say: "You're not listening to me"
- You say: "No. You were talking about--"
- Pick up last couple seconds from echoic memory

'''

=== Short-Term Memory

*Question:*
- "Anybody remember what I just said?"

*If You Did:*
- That's short-term memory

*Duration:*
- Spans for few minutes

'''

=== Long-Term Memory

*Questions:*
- "Anybody know who Elvis is?"
- "Do you know your name?"
- "Do you know where you live?"

*Characteristics:*
- Long-term memory store that you walk around with
- Not going to lose right away

'''

=== When Think About Amnesia in Movie Sense

*Standard Conception:*
- Think of certain loss of long-term memory
- Associated with autobiographical personal events

'''

== Part 14: More Memory Distinctions

=== Implicit vs. Explicit Memory

*Will Talk in More Detail:*

*Explicit (Crudely):*
- What you have conscious access to
- Example: What you had for dinner last night
- Could think back and say: "I had this for dinner last night"

*Implicit:*
- More unconscious
- Examples:
- What certain word means
- What word "had" means
- How to walk
- How to ride bicycle
- Might not be able to articulate
- Might not even be conscious of
- But still have access to

'''

=== Semantic vs. Episodic Memory

*Semantic Memory:*
- Basically facts
- What word means
- What's capital of Canada
- And so on

*Episodic:*
- Autobiography
- What happened to you

*Examples:*

*Semantic:*
- Yale is in New Haven

*Episodic:*
- You went on vacation away from New Haven last week

'''

=== Encoding, Storage, and Retrieval

*Refers to Different Levels of What Happens in Memory:*

*Encoding:*
- Getting memory in
- As when you study for test
- Or you have experience

*Storage:*
- Holding the memory

*Retrieval:*
- Getting memory out

'''

=== Retrieval: Recall vs. Recognition

*Often Broken Conveniently Into:*

*Recall:*
- When you just pull it out of memory

*Recognition:*
- When you recognize what corresponds to something in past

*Example:*

*Question:*
- "Anybody remember what color tie I had on two days ago?"
- [Silence]
- "That would be impossible to remember"

*But:*
- "If I asked you: 'Is it purple or is it orange?'"
- That would be much easier

'''

== Part 15: Stages of Memory

=== Crude Breakdown

*Start:*
- Sensory memory
- Just stuff that comes in

*Leading To:*
- Short-term memory

*Leading To:*
- Long-term memory

*This Stage Theory:*
- Something we'll discuss in more detail

'''

=== This Leads to Issue of Attention

*Question:*
- How do you get memory from your sensations, from what you're hearing?

*Example:*
- Lecturer speaking to you
- You're hearing
- How does it ever get in to other systems?

*Key Question:*
- What decides what's remembered and what's not?

'''

=== What's Happening to You Now

*All Sorts of Things:*
- Seat of your chair pressing against your butt
- Wouldn't say: "Oh, I want to remember this forever"
- Your neighbor exuding certain sort of smell
- You're thinking about something
- Your eyes follow him
- Not everything gets in memory

*Consequence:*
- Would go mad if tried to remember everything
- You can't

'''

=== Role of Attention

*Question:*
- What determines what gets into memory?

*Answer:*
- "Attention does"

*Attention:*
- Could be crudely viewed as flashlight, spotlight on experience
- Willingly zooms in on something
- Makes it memorable

'''

== Part 16: Properties of Attention

=== Effortless vs. Effortful Attention

*Some Things Come to Attention:*
- Effortlessly and automatically

'''

=== Demonstration 1: Pop-Out Effect

*Setup:*
- Going to see array of letters
- One of them's going to be green
- When you see green one, please clap

*Result:*
- Easy task
- Green letter pops out

'''

=== Demonstration 2: Effortful Search

*Task:*
- "Find the red 'o'"

*Result:*
- Much harder
- Requires conscious search

'''

=== Involuntary Attention: Stroop Effect

*Demonstration Setup:*

*Part 1: Name Colors*
- Easy: Just go down colors

*Part 2: Name Colors of Words*
- Words present but just name colors
- Also easy

*Part 3: Color-Word Conflict*
- Word "red" printed in blue
- Word "blue" printed in green
- Task: Name the color, not read word

*Result:*
- Very difficult
- Slower
- Many errors
- Can't help but read word

*This Is Stroop Effect:*
- Being expert reader
- Knowledge of reading
- Attention to what words meant
- Subverted desire to do task
- Couldn't make that go away even if wanted to

*Impossibility:*
- If somebody gave you $1,000 to read this as fast as you read [simple colors]
- Would be unable to
- Can't block it

'''

== Part 17: Selective Attention and Inattentional Blindness

=== Gorilla Study

*Setup:*
- See two teams of basketball players
- One team: White T-shirts
- Other team: Black T-shirts
- Passing balls back and forth

*Task:*
- Count in your head how many passes white team does with ball

*Results:*

*Question:*
- "What number did people get?"

*Follow-up Question:*
- "Did anybody notice anything unusual?"

*Some People:*
- Did not notice anything unusual

*For Those Who Didn't:*
- "Watch this again and just watch it"

*Key Finding:*
- About 50% of people when counting
- Who have never seen this before
- Don't notice anything [gorilla walks through]

*But:*
- When you're not counting
- Kind of obvious what you're missing

*Conclusion:*
- One demonstration among many
- When you're attending to something
- Have very small window of attention
- Lose focus on other things

'''

== Part 18: Change Blindness

=== Film Study

*Setup:*
- Watch movie
- Pay attention very closely to what happens
- Try to remember

*Questions:*
- "How many of you noticed something odd in that movie?"
- "How many of you didn't?"

*Second Viewing:*
- "Now everybody look at":
- The scarf
- Color of plates
- The food
- Among other things

'''

=== The Phenomena: Change Blindness

*Definition:*
- Tend to be oblivious to other things that go on in environment
- When there's focus of attention focused in certain way

*General Pattern:*
- Often quite difficult when there's change in scene
- To notice what changes and what stays same

'''

=== Flicker Task Demonstration

*Setup:*
- Two pictures flicking back and forth
- Clap when you see what's different between two pictures

*Results:*
- Many people struggle
- Some never see difference
- Takes long time for others

'''

=== Dan Simons' Research

*Lecturer:*
- "This is work by Dan Simons"
- Part of extraordinarily interesting body of work on "change blindness"

*The Phenomena:*
- We have very narrow focus of attention
- Huge changes can happen that we are oblivious to

*Movie Continuity:*
- Why so much difficulty with continuity changes in movies

'''

=== Real-World Studies

*Cornell Campus Study:*

*Setup:*
- Get unsuspecting person walking through campus
- Guy comes over
- Says: "Excuse me, Sir. I'm lost. Could you help me with directions?"
- Has map
- Person says: "Sure"
- Then: Two construction workers holding door
- Going to rudely bump between these two characters
- Experimenter gets switched with another guy

*Result:*
- When two guys walk away
- Subject standing there with entirely different person
- What's interesting: Nobody notices

*Exceptions:*
- They notice if person changes sexes
- "Didn't you used to be a woman?"
- They notice if experimenter changes races
- But most other changes: Oblivious to

'''

=== Human Subject Form Study

*Setup (Brian Scholl or Dan Simons):*
- Subject comes in to lab
- "If you're going to do experiment with us, need to sign human subject form"
- Hands form to subject
- Subject signs form
- Experimenter takes form
- Says: "Thank you. I'll put it down here"
- Goes down
- Then: Different person pops up

*Result:*
- People don't notice

'''

=== General Conclusions

*Pattern:*
- Certain level on which we're oblivious to changes

*What's Weird:*
- We don't think we are
- We think we see world as it is
- Don't notice that when attending to something
- Everything else gets blanked out

*Gorilla Study:*
- About 50% of people who have never seen demo before
- Don't notice gorilla
- Couldn't imagine anything more obvious

'''

=== Historical Note

*Gorilla Study:*
- Actually done very long time ago
- Originally done in different way
- [Lecturer attempts to show original study but has technical difficulties with DVD]

'''

== Part 19: Question and Answer on Attention and Memory

=== Question 1: Why Does Practice Make Things Automatic?

*Student Question:*
- Why does it work that way?
- Why do things that become very practiced become automatic and involuntary?

*Answer:*
- Good question
- "I don't know"
- We know that they do

*Examples:*

*Reading:*
- Once you know how to read
- Can't not read

*Listening:*
- If lecturer talking to you
- Even if extremely boring
- Very hard not to listen
- Can't shut off your ears
- Could put fingers in them
- But can't shut off ears

*Vision:*
- Can't shut your eyes without actually shutting them
- Can't say: "This is disgusting movie. I'm not going to attend to it"

*General Pattern:*
- Not answering your question
- Just saying observation is right one
- And more general one
- When you're good at something and over-practiced
- Becomes involuntary
- You cannot stop it

'''

=== Question 2: Did Man with Amnesia Remember Before Accident?

*Student Question:*
- Did he remember things right before his accident?

*Answer:*
- Yes
- He had some amnesia of events before his accident
- But did remember things
- Knew his name
- Knew other things about his life
