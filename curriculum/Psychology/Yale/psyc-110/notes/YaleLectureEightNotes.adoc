= Psychology Lecture Notes: Memory Systems, Retrieval, and False Memories

== Introduction: Change Blindness in Real World

=== Dan Simons' Cornell Study

*Background:*
- One of first studies done by Dan Simons when at Cornell
- Adviser at time was Frank Keil (now in Yale department)
- Videotapes not available publicly
- Get them from web as little Java scripts

*The Study:*
- [Video demonstration of person switching during interaction]
- People don't notice the switch

'''

=== Big Moral of Change Blindness

*What You Think You're Experiencing:*

*Right Now:*
- You think you're perceiving the world
- Lecturer looks down and thinks has whole sense of where everybody is
- Can't see everybody perfectly in back
- People kind of far away and blurry
- But: There's sense of having world around

*When Close Eyes:*
- Everything just remains
- Could sort of remember some things that are there

*Your Perception:*
- Looking up
- Think you have sense of world both in perception and memory

'''

*What Change-Blindness Experiments Suggest:*

*This Isn't True*

*Scenario 1:*
- If you look at lecturer for second
- During that second all classmates change positions
- Including those next to you
- You are extremely unlikely to notice

*Scenario 2:*
- Turn eyes away from lecturer towards there for second
- Turn back
- Lecturer dressed entirely differently
- You wouldn't notice

*Exception:*
- If you told yourself consciously: "Remember what this guy is wearing; he's wearing this, that and the other"
- But if don't do it consciously: You'll lose it

'''

=== Why This Is Usually Okay

*Basic Fact About Universe:*
- Most things stay same most of time

*Memory and Visual System Exploit This:*
- Don't have to explicitly remember that you're over there when turn head for second
- Because: You'll be over there in any case
- Don't need to hold precise representations of world

*Only Notice in Certain Clever Circumstances:*

*1. Psychologists Change Reality:*
- As in change-blindness studies

*2. Movies:*
- Big surprises when people started making movies involving cuts
- Extremely difficult to get everything continuously right
- Need to work very hard to notice
- All these continuity errors creep up into movies
- Have to be film buff or writing it down to even notice this

*Overall Moral:*
- Your perception of reality is lot more sparse, lot more limited, than you might think it is

'''

== Part 1: Review - Types of Memory

=== Where We Were at End of Last Class

*Different Sorts of Memories:*

*Sensory Memory:*
- Fraction of second of sensory residue
- Of what you're hearing and seeing

*Working Memory / Short-Term Memory*

*Long-Term Memory*

*Topics Covered:*
- How things get into sensory memory
- Into working memory
- Role of attention
- Change-blindness studies: Actually just studies of how something gets from senses to consciousness
- What does and what doesn't

'''

== Part 2: Distinction Between Short-Term and Long-Term Memory

=== Storage Differences

*Long-Term Memory (LTM):*

*Huge Storage Capacity:*
- Like hard drive of your computer
- Memory you walk around with

*What It Includes:*
- All words in English
- Just for example: 60 to 80,000 words
- Everybody you've ever met
- Languages
- Faces
- Stories
- Locations
- Nursery rhymes
- Songs
- TV programs

*Nobody Knows the Storage:*
- NOT true that you remember everything that has ever happened to you
- No reason to believe this is true
- At same time: Have huge amount stored in brain in long-term storage
- Nobody actually--Has to be limited because it's finite, limited brain
- But nobody knows how big it is
- Nobody knows how many terabytes you carry around in brain
- But: It's a lot

'''

*Working Memory / Short-Term Memory:*

*Actually Very Limited:*
- Memory of what you could store in consciousness right now
- Quite limited

'''

=== Demonstration: Memory Capacity

*Exercise:*
- Do not write these things down
- Want you to remember them
- Going to give you few numbers

*Numbers Given:*
```
14, 59, 11, 109, 43, 58, 98, 487, 25, 389, 54
```

*Then:*
- "Please write them down"

*Results:*

*Class Survey:*
- "How many got three or less?" [Some hands]
- "Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or more?"
- "Anybody get all eleven?"

*Assessment:*
- Particularly difficult memory task
- Numbers are meaningless
- Forgot to tell people to get pen and pencil ready

'''

=== George Miller's Finding: Seven Plus or Minus Two

*Under Normal Circumstances:*
- Standard memory storage of short-term memory is seven, plus or minus two

*What That Means:*
- Anywhere from five to nine roughly

*Individual Variation:*
- Some can beat that
- Some on not-so-good day maybe won't make it that much

*"Seven Plus or Minus Two":*
- What you hold in consciousness
- Can tell you 14, 21
- You walk around: "Oh, yeah, 14, 21"
- Hold that in consciousness with no problem
- But throw eleven numbers at you: Can't
- Some dribble out
- Can't hold that in conscious window in short-term memory

'''

== Part 3: Chunks - The Unit of Memory

=== The Question: Seven Plus or Minus Two What?

*Answer:*
- What George Miller calls "chunks"

*Definition of Chunk:*
- Basic memory unit
- Something you think of as single, individual entity

'''

=== Example 1: String of Letters

*Letters: "L, A, M, A, I, S, O, N"*

*If Can't Form Into Words:*
- Have to remember them
- These are eight chunks
- Have to pick them up separately

*If Break Up Into Four Words:*
- Could just remember as four chunks

*If Break Up Into Two Words in French:*
- "La maison" ("the house")
- Could just be one or two chunks

*Principle:*
- How much you know affects how much you could store in memory
- Because: Affects what counts as basic unit of memory

'''

=== Example 2: Binary Numbers

*Numbers: "1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0"*

*If Don't Know Binary Numbers:*
- Might have to remember as "1, 1, 0, 0," whatever was said

*If Know Binary Numbers:*
- Computer scientists or mathematicians
- Could convert into single binary number
- "Anybody know what the number is?" [Someone guesses 24]
- "Some number, 24, and then you remember '24'"
- It's easier

'''

=== Example 3: Chessboard

*If Don't Know How to Play Chess:*
- Murderously hard to remember chessboard
- They've done experiments
- Taken people in lab who don't know how to play chess
- Set up chessboard
- "Okay. Look at this for five minutes"
- Take it away, set it up again
- Murderously hard
- "There is a horse-y thing on the side there and everything"

*If Chess Pieces Set Up Logically:*
- Chess master could look at it and remember it in glance
- "Oh. It's the Fibonacci defense" or something like that
- Then immediately recover it

'''

=== Example 4: Football Diagrams

*Football Coaches:*
- Have been tested on memories of football diagrams
- Have photographic memory for football diagrams
- Because: Corresponds to things that make sense

'''

=== Example 5: Floor Plans

*Architects:*
- Could have photographic memory, perfect memory for floor plans
- Because: Makes sense to them
- They understand it

'''

=== General Principle

*Way You Store Things in Memory:*
- Depends in large extent on how much you understand it
- This is theme we're going to return to when get to long-term memory

*Shows Up In:*
- Expertise effects

'''

== Part 4: Getting Information Into Long-Term Memory

=== The Question

*So Far:*
- Short-term memory
- How much you hold in there

*Question:*
- How do you get it into long-term memory?

*You Have:*
- Long-term memory: Major storage system

*How Does Information Get:*
- From your consciousness to long-term storage?

'''

=== Maintenance Rehearsal (Doesn't Work Well)

*One Way:*
- Sort of works sometimes but not very well
- Called "maintenance rehearsal"

*Example:*

*Setup:*
- "Suppose I said you have to remember this number, this string of numbers"
- "If you remember it in twenty minutes you will get one thousand dollars"

*String:*
- Lecturer's phone number when he was a kid
- Include area code: 514-688-9057

*Four-Year-Old:*
- Tell that to four-year-old
- Four-year-old will say: "I'll remember it"
- Then ask them: "What did I just say?"
- "Well, I don't know"

*Adult:*
- Because you know something
- If a lot depended on it, would know to do something

*What You Would Do:*
- Say to yourself: "514-688-9057, 514-688-9057, 514-688--"
- Rehearse it in your head over and over again

'''

*The Problem:*

*Could Hold It:*
- As long as you can do that

*Like Movies:*
- See this all the time
- Episode of 24: "Jack, call CTU and tell them Agent 11 is trapped in a--"
- Can't even remember this
- Way to remember: Hold it
- Just got to repeat it over and over again in head

*But:*
- This will not typically get things into long-term memory

'''

== Part 5: Structure and Organization for Long-Term Memory

=== What You Need

*To Get Things Into Long-Term Memory:*
- Rehearsal is usually not enough
- Need to do other things

*Typically:*
- What you need is structure and organization

'''

=== Classic "Depth of Processing" Experiment

*Purpose:*
- Nicely illustrates fact that:
- More you structure something
- Deeper you think about it
- Better it gets entrenched in long-term memory

'''

*The Study:*

*Setup:*
- Asked people/told people: Going to be words flashed on screen
- All subjects saw same strings of words
- Forty-eight words
- Were NOT told to memorize words

*Three Groups:*

*Group 1: Structural Processing*
- Told: "Look. Some of these words going to come out in capital letters, some not capital letters"
- "Press button for capitals, non-capitals"
- "Sure"

*Group 2: Phonemic Processing*
- Told: "Some of these words will rhyme with 'train.' Others won't"
- "Press button if it rhymes with 'train'"

*Group 3: Semantic Processing*
- Told: "Does it fit into sentence 'The girl placed the blank on the table'?"
- "Press button if it does"
- "Press button if it doesn't"

'''

*Results:*

*Then:*
- Asked as surprise: "What words did you see?"

*Findings:*
- When asked to focus on just what word looked like: Memory very poor
- Sound: Better
- Meaning: Better

*Conclusion:*
- If you want to remember something
- Best way to remember it: Give it meaning, give it sense

'''

=== Memory Tricks: Ancient Technique

*Illustrated Through:*
- Very ancient technique

*The Way to Remember Things That Are Otherwise Arbitrary:*
- Give them some organization through memory tricks
- Through vivid imagery
- Or songs
- Or poetry

'''

=== Examples of Memory Tricks

*Example 1: Hippocampus*

*Part of Brain:*
- Called hippocampus

*Memory Trick:*
- "This is worst memory trick ever but will stick with you for twenty years"

*Function:*
- Hippocampus involved in spatial memory
- Involved in finding your way around

*The Trick:*
- Think to yourself: "The way I find my way around campus is through the hippocampus"
- You think: "Well, that's stupid"
- But: You'll never forget now that hippocampus is in charge of spatial memory
- "Going to be all you retain from this course"

'''

*Example 2: Remembering Names*

*Memory Books:*
- On how to remember people's names
- Usually try to exploit this sort of thing
- Try to get poetry or dramatic images

*Typical Approach:*
- Meet somebody with very spiky hair
- They say: "My name is Mr. Fish"
- Then you remember/think of their--of big fish impaled on their hair
- Whenever you see them: Remember their name

*Limitation:*
- "Only really works for names like 'Fish'"

*The Idea:*
- Try to generate vivid imagery

'''

*General Strategies:*

*Ten Letters:*
- Turn into song
- Or dirty poem
- Where each of letters is first words of it

*Something Totally Arbitrary:*
- Try to figure out grand and obscene image that will come to mind easily

*These Are:*
- One way to get things into memory

'''

=== Deep Level: Understanding

*At Deep Level:*
- Way to get things into memory
- Applies to this course no less than anything else
- Is by understanding it

'''

=== Demonstration: Memory and Context

*Setup:*
- "I'm going to read you something"
- "I want you to try your best to remember what I tell you"
- Not going to be strings of numbers
- Going to be series of sentences

*Sentences Read:*

```
"A newspaper is better than a magazine.
A seashore is a better place than the street.
At first it is better to run than to walk.
You may have to try several times.
It takes some skill but it's easy to learn.
Even young children can enjoy it.
Once successful, complications are minimal.
Birds seldom get too close.
Rain, however, soaks in very fast.
Too many people doing the same things can also cause problems.
One needs lots of room.
If there are no complications, it can be very peaceful.
Finally, a rock will serve as an anchor.
If things break loose from it, however, you will not have a second chance."
```

*Assessment:*
- "Murderously hard to remember"

*Then:*
- Shows picture [of kite flying]

*Now Try It:*
- Knowing what this is about
- Being able to put context to it
- Helps the memory
- Helps it come to mind

'''

== Part 6: Memory Retrieval

=== The Problem

*Context:*
- Exam period
- Got stuff presumably into your head
- Have to get it out
- Have to retrieve it

*Other Situations:*
- Court case
- Have to recount crime that you witnessed
- See somebody
- Want to know his or her name
- You heard it
- Just have to get it out

*Question:*
- How do you do that?

'''

=== Retrieval Cues

*Retrieval Cues Make Sense:*
- Just things that have been associated with what you're trying to remember

*Examples:*

*Example 1:*
- Have to remember to replace windows
- When walk into living room
- See that window is cracked
- That will remind to replace windows

*Example 2:*
- Had lunch date with you
- Forgot about it
- When see you: "Oh, yeah. We were supposed to get together to have lunch"

*Function:*
- Retrieval cues bring things back

*But:*
- Little bit more complicated than that

'''

=== Compatibility Principle / Context-Dependent Memory

*More General Relationship:*
- Between encoding and retrieval
- Called "compatibility principle"

*What This Means:*
- Much better to remember something in context in which you have learned it

*Also Known As:*
- Context-dependent memory
- State-dependent memory

'''

=== Strange Underwater Experiment

*One of Strangest Experiments in History of Psychology:*

*Setup:*
- Had people on boat
- Then had them scuba dive underwater
- Taught them things either:
- On boat
- Or underwater with things they held up
- Then tested them later

*Results:*
- Turns out: You'll remember it better if tested on it in context in which you learned it

*Explanation:*
- Might be because then retrieval cues help bring it back

'''

=== More General Than Environment

*Applies to This Class:*
- If have to remember something you learned in this class
- Will do better if try to think about room in which you learned it in
- Will do better on final exam if were to take it in this room
- Than if were to take it in another room
- Because: Being in this room will bring back cues

'''

*Not Just Environment:*

*Learning While Stoned:*
- People who learn things when they're stoned
- Remember them better
- Keeping stoned at sort of low-level that doesn't disrupt other mental activities
- Remember them better when sort of stoned again
- Than if they're non-stoned

*Similarly:*
- "If you study while you drink"
- "Should tipple a little bit before coming in to Final exam"

*General Pattern:*
- "Sort of like 'what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas' sort of result"

'''

*Mood:*
- Similarly: Even applies to moods
- If you learn something when depressed
- Have slightly better recovery of it when you're in same mood of depression
- Than when you're elated

*The Idea:*
- Part of what memory is
- Part of what recovering memory is
- Is getting back your original context in which you learned it

'''

=== Elaborative Rehearsal

*Elaborative Rehearsal:*
- Involves connections between different things

*Definition:*
- More you think about something
- Easier it is to remember

*If Have to Remember Something:*
- Try to connect it to as many things as possible
- Think of an image
- Make joke out of it
- Imagine how you would explain it to somebody else
- Imagine what world would be like if it wasn't so

*The Idea:*
- This sort of thinking about it makes connections in your memory
- From that thing you have to learn, to other memories
- So: Makes it easier to recover

'''

=== Elaborative Retrieval

*Refers to Finding:*
- When you want to get something back out of memory
- People tend to give up too soon

*Turns Out:*
- Lot of stuff that's in your memory
- But: Needs work to extract
- Needs various sort of searching strategies

'''

*Study: High School Classmates*

*Setup:*
- Asked people who were considerably older than students
- To remember their high school classmates

*First Pass:*
- People were terrible
- Maybe had couple of friends they kept in touch with
- Otherwise: Pretty bad

*Good Experiment:*
- Could use high school yearbooks to judge whether or not they get it right

*Then:*
- Tell person: "Look. Keep trying"
- "Who was your teacher?"
- "What sort of clubs did you belong to?"
- "What sort of sports did you participate in?"
- "How did you get to school?"
- "How did you get from school?"
- "What did you do during lunch?"
- "What did you do during break?"
- "Do you know have any friends whose letter--whose last name began with 'B,' with 'C,' with 'D'?"
- Keep pushing and pushing and pushing

*Over Span of Time:*
- Things come back

*Important Qualification:*
- "Again, not true that you never forget"
- "There is honest to God forgetting"
- But: Sometimes you think you forget
- Because: Haven't looked long enough

*Real Physical Notion:*
- Of searching for right answer

'''

=== Déjà Vu

*Student Question:*
- Every class: Somebody asks either in class or by email
- What about déjà vu?

*Definition:*
- Déjà vu is feeling that event has happened before

*Example:*
- Looking at lecturer lecturing
- Say: "I've heard this before. I know this before"
- See somebody
- Say: "I've been in this situation before"

*Not Evidence For:*
- Psychic powers
- Which many people say it is

*But:*
- Nobody really knows why this exists

'''

*Clue:*
- We know: It's worse with frontal lobe damage
- If you get damage to this part of brain
- Get lot more déjà vu experiences

*Asked Experts:*
- Including Marcia Johnson (chair of department)
- "What's best explanation for déjà vu?"

'''

*Best Theory:*

*Déjà Vu:*
- Is feeling that it's happened before

*Answer:*
- It HAS happened before
- It's happened half a second ago

*What Happens:*
- Sometimes there is glitch
- Disturbance in the force
- There's a glitch
- You are talking
- Then something happens to you
- You put it in your memory
- But: It's as if you don't put stamp on it of what time and what date

*So:*
- Talking to lecturer
- Then you store it in memory
- But: Don't store it in memory as happening right now
- Then half second goes by
- You're talking to lecturer
- You say: "This is strangely familiar"

*That's One Theory:*
- Of what goes on in déjà vu

'''

== Part 7: Memory Failure - Forgetting

=== Good News vs. Bad News

*So Far:*
- Sort of good news: Remembering

*But Then:*
- Bad news: Forgetting

'''

=== Demonstration: Forgetting Numbers

*Question to Class:*
- "How many people can remember, without looking down at notes, at least two of numbers I gave you earlier?"
- [Some hands]
- "How many people can remember at least four?"
- "Oh, impressive"

*If Asked in an Hour:*
- Number would go down

*These Are:*
- Sort of statistics in similar experiment

*Graph:*
- Illustrates that people forget
- Over time: You'll forget

'''

=== Why Forgetting? Three Explanations

*Question:*
- Why is there forgetting at all?

'''

#### Explanation 1: Physical Decay

*Your Brain:*
- Physical thing
- Physical piece of meat
- Kind of goes bad

*Physical Things Decay:*
- Memory traces that are laid onto your brain will just decay over time

'''

#### Explanation 2: Interference

*Remember Those Numbers?*
- Here's few more: 114, 81, 66, 42

*Principle:*
- More information that comes in that's similar to stuff you're trying to remember
- It blocks your recovery of original information

*Result:*
- Your ability to remember something can be impaired by learning more things which are related to it
- Because: They get confused in memory

'''

#### Explanation 3: Changes in Retrieval Cues

*Finally:*
- Maybe this is most interesting

*Principle:*
- More time goes by: More the world changes
- If your memory is to some extent dependent on cues bringing it back to life
- Then: Change in retrieval cues can make it more difficult to recall certain things

'''

== Part 8: Childhood Amnesia

=== The Puzzle

*Leads to Puzzle:*
- Considerable scientific debate over case of childhood amnesia

*Childhood Amnesia:*
- Doesn't refer to when child gets brain damage and gets amnesia
- What it refers to: People have difficult time recovering very early memories

'''

=== Exercise: First Memory

*Want People To:*
- Take second
- Try to think back on what your first memory is
- Roughly how old you were

'''

*Survey Results:*

*Question:*
- "How many people don't think you have first memory until you were about five years old or older?" [Some hands]

*Question:*
- "How many people think you have first memory of around age four or younger?"

*Question:*
- "How many people think you have first memory of around age three or younger?"

*Question:*
- "Two or younger?"

*Question:*
- "How many of you think you have first memory when you were about one years old or younger?"
- "Not asking about past lives"

'''

*Individual Examples:*

*Student 1:*
- "Between one and two"

*Question:*
- "Anybody think they could beat that?"

*Student 2:*
- "One"

'''

=== Problems with Research

*Literature Is Unclear:*
- Very difficult to test people's recollections of first memories

*If Ask People:*
- They'll often say: "Oh, yeah. I remember I was in this room and there was crib and I'm going 'Ga ga, goo goo' and I was on potty. I was walking. I was so cute. I remember it"

*Very Difficult to Tell:*
- As we'll discuss in some detail
- Lot of reasons to distrust people when they--not that they're lying
- But: To distrust accuracy of people's memories

'''

*Studies About Trauma:*
- Know from studies about trauma
- Where people have terrible experiences when they're one or two
- Typically: This trauma is not remembered later on
- People know of trauma because they're told about it
- But: Don't typically remember it with any accuracy

*Even Children:*
- Older children don't remember back beyond that age

'''

=== Why Childhood Amnesia Occurs

*Status:*
- Nobody knows why childhood amnesia occurs
- Nobody knows why it's very difficult to recover memories before about age of three

'''

#### Theory 1: Retrieval Cues Change Radically

*Example from Friend:*
- Friend who's clinical psychologist
- Suggested new form of therapy
- Make giant tables and chairs
- Then bring you into office
- You're standing there with giant tables and chairs
- All these memories of being baby would come flooding back
- "And he dropped out of field"
- "Really, but it's such cool idea"

'''

#### Theory 2: Language Is to Blame

*Some People Think:*

*Child Development:*
- Baby starts out with no spoken or signed language
- Language comes to be learned at around one, two, and three

*Might Be:*
- Learning of language reformats your memory
- Once memory is reformatted
- Can't go back to previous state prior to language in end

'''

#### Theory 3: Neural Maturation

*Could Be:*
- Neural maturation
- Could be that memory parts of brains grow around age two or three
- That just weren't there prior to that

*Status:*
- Nobody really knows
- Fascinating research area
- Why--about memory changes early on

'''

== Part 9: Brain Damage and Amnesia

=== Two Types of Amnesia

*Another Case of Memory Failure:*
- Brain damage

*Brain Damage Comes In:*
- Couple of flavors

'''

=== Retrograde Amnesia

*"Retro" for Past:*

*Definition:*
- When you lose some memory of past

*Could Be:*
- Case where you get some sort of head trauma
- Lose memory of entire episodic memory

*Typically:*
- If you have any sort of serious accident that involves losing consciousness
- You'll have blackout of some period prior to that
- Say, blow to head

'''

*Reason for This:*
- As you're having these experiences now
- They need to kind of get consolidated into your brain
- Your brain needs to rewire and catch up to experiences you're having
- Sudden blow to head will knock you unconscious
- Then: Memories that have happened immediately prior will not get consolidated
- They'll be lost forever

'''

=== Anterograde Amnesia

*Another Sort of Memory:*

*Happens In:*
- Korsakoff's syndrome
- Happens to very famous patient known as H.M. (actually lives in Hartford, Connecticut)
- Happened to Clive Wearing (film you saw last class)

*This Sort of Amnesia:*
- Sort of amnesia where you lose ability to form new memories
- So: You live in perpetual present
- Unable to accumulate new memories

'''

*Actually Little Bit More Complicated:*

*Exciting Discovery:*
- About these patients
- Led to some real insights about normal memory

*Brain Damage in These Cases:*
- Temporal lobe
- Hippocampus (very useful for spatial memory you'll know)

'''

=== Discovery: Can Form New Memories (Of Certain Types)

*Example Task:*
- Filling in star while looking into mirror
- If asked you to do it: Find it pretty difficult
- Just kind of difficult to do
- Be clumsy at it

*Bring In Amnesic:*
- Who can't form new memories
- Say: "Hey. I want you to try something new. I want you to try this star game"
- He'd say: "Okay. I've never seen it before but I'll do it"
- Tries it
- Does very badly

*Bring Him In Over and Over Again:*
- Each time he does it: Starts off by saying "I've never seen this before. I'll--I'm sure I'll give it try"
- But: He gets better and better at it

'''

*This Is Known As:*
- Implicit memory

*The Claim:*
- In these sorts of cases you lose abilities to form explicit conscious memories
- That you're aware of
- That you understand
- But: Some sorts of memories persist
- You are able to form them

'''

=== Movies Illustrating This

*Bad Movie:*
- Drew Barrymore loses ability to form new memories
- Somehow falls in love with Adam Sandler
- "Definitely don't watch that"

*Very Good Movie:*
- "Memento"
- About character who loses ability to form new memories
- While trying to track down wife's killer
- "Memento" is movie which is fascinating
- Because: Told backwards
- But throughout "Memento": Another story told forwards

*Likes This Story Because:*
- Very dramatically illustrates
- What does, and what is and is not impaired
- In cases of severe memory damage

*Shows Clips:*
- That illustrate disassociation from "Memento"
- "Those of you who have seen movie know this ends up quite tragically for Sammy"
- "Highly recommend movie"

'''

== Part 10: Everyday Forgetting Summary

*We've Dealt Right Now With:*
- Two sorts of failures of memory

'''

=== Type 1: Everyday Failure

*Question to Class:*
- "How many of you remember three or more of numbers I originally presented?"

*Student Response:*
- [Gives three numbers]
- "Fourteen, 59, 11"

*Question:*
- "Is that right?" [Laughs]

*Follow-Up:*
- "I'm going to ask you again in a month"

*Comment:*
- "Well, people are supposed to forget"
- "Some things will--you will forget"

*Status:*
- Normal forgetting

'''

=== Type 2: Forgetting Due to Brain Damage

*Characteristics:*
- Exotic and unusual

*But Interesting:*
- Illustrates some more general themes about how mind works

*Remember:*
- One theme of this course
- Going to look at exotic cases like case of Clive Wearing
- Not just because they're interesting in own right
- But: Sometimes by looking at extremes
- Could learn something about how normal people's normal, intact minds and brains work

'''

== Part 11: False Memories - Power of Suggestion

=== Introduction to Third Type of Forgetting

*The Third Case:*
- More interesting

'''

=== Sam Stone Demonstration

*Setup:*
- "What I want to do is you to listen to three children describe event that happened"
- "Want you to come to some--your own guess"
- "Imagine you were judge, childcare worker"
- "Wanted to see--want you to be--come to your own guess about who you believe and what you think happened"

*Shows Three Children:*
- Describing what happened

'''

*Question to Class:*
- "You've heard three children. Who do you believe?"
- "There's three of them, one, two, three"
- "Who believes first one?"
- "Who believes second one?"
- "Who believes third one?"

*Result:*
- Sort of even split

'''

=== Expert Survey

*Twenty-Three Hundred Experts:*
- Were shown these films
- Asked about different actions:
- Whether or not person ripped book
- Messed up bear
- Tossed book in air

*As You Could See:*
- Majority thought that he did

'''

=== The Truth

*This Is Work Done By:*
- Steve Ceci
- Who was gracious enough to lend film to use for teaching purposes

*Turns Out:*
- Second girl was right
- Absolutely nothing happened

*What Actually Happened:*
- Teacher said: "There is somebody named Sam Stone who's going to come in"
- Guy walks in
- Says: "Hi"
- Walks around
- Leaves

'''

=== How Memories Were Implanted

*First and Third Children:*
- Had their memories implanted
- Not through any sort of science fiction means

*Method:*
- Some of children would just ask questions
- Interviewer, by way, was herself unaware of what happened
- Interviewer was perfectly naive interviewer

*Turns Out:*
- If you just interview children
- Ask them questions about whether book was ripped
- "Did you see him? Did he really do it?"
- They don't say anything
- Didn't see anything
- Won't say anything

'''

=== Experimental Conditions

*Condition 1: Stereotype*

*Other Children:*
- Were told about Sam Stone
- Were told stereotype about Sam Stone
- That he's very clumsy
- Tends to rip things
- Trips
- Breaks things
- Spills things

*In Fact:*
- Third child mentioned that in passing
- Said: "He always does that"

*Result:*
- Just knowing this about Sam Stone tends to raise proportion of kids who say, for instance, that he ripped book

'''

*Condition 2: Suggestive Questioning*

*Other Children:*
- Were given suggestions
- Were given suggestive questioning
- Were series of leading questions like:
- "Oh. Sam Stone came in? Did he rip book while he was there?"

'''

*Condition 3: Both Stereotype and Suggestions*

*Still More Children:*
- Got both

*In Fact:*
- Children you saw were from this group
- Heard Sam Stone being described as clumsy fellow
- Were given series of suggestive questionings

*In This Condition:*
- Given several suggestive questionings over period of several months

'''

=== Key Points

*These Children:*
- Like first child and third child
- Are NOT lying
- Honestly believe that Sam Stone came in and did these things

*Also:*
- They believe it
- They're so convincing in their belief

*Experts:*
- Including:
- Police officers
- Child caseworkers
- Judges
- Lawyers
- Find these children to be extremely believable

*Thinks:*
- Probably find them to be extremely believable
- Because: Children are not lying
- They really believe they saw what they saw

*But:*
- These memories were implanted

'''

=== Research on Implanted Memories

*Ceci and Many Other Investigators:*
- Study how memories can be implanted in people's minds
- Through suggestion
- Through leading questions

*Turns Out:*
- Same sort of experiments
- Same sort of research
- Has been done with considerable success
- In implanting false memories in adults

'''

== Part 12: False Memories in Adults

=== Dramatic Cases

*There Are:*
- Dramatic cases of people remembering terrible crimes
- Confessing to them
- When actually: They didn't commit them

*This Is Not Because:*
- They are lying

*Not Even Because:*
- They're, in some obvious sense, deranged or schizophrenic or delusional

*Rather:*
- They have persuaded themselves
- Or more often: Been persuaded by others
- That these things have actually happened

'''

=== Laboratory Studies

*Psychologists Have Studied:*
- In laboratory
- How one could do this
- How one can implant memories in other people

'''

=== Basic Techniques

*Some Things Are Sort of Standard:*

*Example:*
- Suppose lecturer was to tell you story about:
- Trip to dentist
- Visit to--or time when ate out at restaurant
- And omit certain details
- Omit fact that paid bill in restaurant, let's say
- Or finished meal and then went home

*Result:*
- Still: You will tend to fill in blanks
- You'll tend to fill in blanks with things you know

*So:*
- Might remember this later saying:
- "Okay. He told me he finished eating, paid bill and left"
- Because: Paying bill is what you do in restaurant

*This Is:*
- Benign enough
- Fill in blanks

'''

=== Integration of Suppositions

*You Also Can:*
- Integrate suppositions made by others

*Clearest Case:*
- Eyewitness testimony

'''

== Part 13: Elizabeth Loftus' Research on Eyewitness Testimony

=== Overview

*Best Research:*
- Done by Elizabeth Loftus

*Series of Studies:*
- Some discussed in textbook
- Showing how people's memories can be swayed by leading questions
- Can be extremely subtle

'''

=== Study 1: "A" vs. "The" Broken Headlight

*In One Experiment:*

*Setup:*
- Person was just asked in course of series of questions
- Shown scene where there's car accident

*Asked Either:*
1. "Did you see a broken headlight?"
2. "Did you see the broken headlight?"

*The 'The':*
- Presupposes that there was broken headlight

*In Fact:*
- People asked: "Did you see the broken headlight?"
- Later on: More likely to remember one
- Creates an image
- They fill it in

'''

=== Study 2: School Bus

*In Another Study:*

*Would Show:*
- Film segments

*Then Ask:*
- "Did you see the children getting on the school bus?"

*Now:*
- There was no school bus

*But:*
- People who hear that question
- Later on when asked: "Did you see school bus in film?"
- More likely to say yes

'''

=== Study 3: "Hit" vs. "Smashed"

*In Another Study:*

*Would Show:*
- People film segments

*Ask Them Either:*
1. "How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?"
2. "How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?"

*Week Later:*
- Bring people back into laboratory
- Ask: "Did you see any broken glass?"

*Result:*
- Those who hear "smashed": Tend to see broken glass more than those who hear "hit"
- Because: Question has changed their memory
- Making it more of dramatic event

'''

== Part 14: Hypnosis and Memory

=== Hypnosis as Reconstructive Process

*Hypnosis:*
- Clearest case where there's sort of reconstructive effort
- Led as result of leading and probing questions

'''

=== Who Can Be Hypnotized

*Some of You:*
- Are readily hypnotizable
- Can be hypnotized

*What We Would Learn:*
- About past event from hypnotizing you
- Will not necessarily then be inaccurate

'''

=== What Hypnotizing Does

*Makes People:*
- Very willing to cooperate

*Unfortunately:*
- Isn't as if there is memory storage there
- Where you could just go through and look
- As in movies where you just say: "What's license plate?"
- Person's hypnotized
- Then flashback comes in
- Then they zoom in on license plate

*Memory Doesn't Work That Way:*
- What happens is--What somebody will do in hypnotizable state
- They'll be very eager to please hypnotist
- So: They'll make stuff up

*People Under Hypnosis:*
- Just make stuff up
- Do very enthusiastically
- Very believably make stuff up

'''

=== Hypnotic Regression

*Particularly Case With:*
- Hypnotic regression
- When we ask you to go back to sixth birthday party, for instance

'''

*What's Great as Developmental Psychologist:*
- If ask you to go back to fourth birthday party
- And you're hypnotizable
- You'll be oh, just like four-year-old

*Except:*
- You won't be like real four-year-old
- What you'll be like is adult's notion of what four-year-old is supposed to be

'''

*Extreme Case:*
- Happened with hypnotic regression
- Where people claim to speak languages like from ancient Egypt

*Linguists Love These Studies:*
- Don't--of course don't really sound like you're speaking language from ancient Egypt
- What you sound is like North American who believes he's speaking language from ancient Egypt
- So they're "nonsense sounds"

'''

*What It Makes You:*
- Hypnotism brings out actor in you
- Makes you want to give persuasive account of what happened

*So:*
- Hypnotism is just extreme form of what normally happens in eyewitness testimony

'''

== Part 15: Repressed Memories

=== Introduction

*Could Devote:*
- Class--Could devote semester
- To very heated debate in United States mostly
- About repressed memories

'''

=== Basic Phenomenon

*Many Adults:*
- Have claimed to have experienced traumatic sexual abuse

*Some Cases:*
- Unexceptional from memory point of view
- People know this happened to them
- They've always known it happens to them
- Then they tell people about it

*Subset of Cases:*
- People have had no memory up to point of what happened to them
- Then: They go to psychologist or psychiatrist
- Undergo questioning
- Often using hypnotic techniques
- Then: They recover memory of past traumatic sexual abuse

'''

=== The Debate

*What Makes This Debatable:*
- There is debate about this
- Lecturer doesn't want to try to preclude it one way or another

'''

*Position 1: Memories Are Real*

*Some Psychologists Believe:*
- In at least some cases
- These memories are real
- Have been repressed through Freudian mechanism
- They're too terrible to bring to consciousness
- Therapy brings them out into real life

'''

*Position 2: Memories Are Created*

*Most Psychologists Believe:*
- These memories cannot be trusted
- These memories are created through actions of therapist

'''

=== Legal Battles

*Actually:*
- Considerable psychological and legal battles
- Over veracity of therapists

*Cases:*

*Women's Claims:*
- Women who have claimed to have been sexually abused
- Have pressed criminal charges against fathers
- On basis of false memories

*Fathers' Claims:*
- Similarly: People who have been accused of sexual abuse
- Have pressed criminal charges against psychiatrists
- Claiming: These psychiatrists have implanted memories into their sons and daughters

'''

=== Status

*Controversial:*
- Whether memories are ever repressed

*Not Controversial:*
- For at least some cases
- Can implant false memories in people

*Not Because:*
- You're sinister or evil person

*But Because:*
- You really believed something happened
- Talked to them about it
- Then: Caused these memories to come into being

'''

== Part 16: Flashbulb Memories

=== Introduction

*Asked Early in Semester:*
- Will ask again

*Question:*
- "How many of you remember where you were on September 11, 2001?"

*Follow-Up:*
- "Is there anybody who doesn't remember where they were on September 11, 2001?"
- "Would be interesting"

*Nature of Event:*
- Socially relevant event

'''

=== Problem with Flashbulb Memories

*Here's the Problem:*

*Flashbulb Memories:*
- Idea that these memories being so vivid
- And they are vivid for many of us
- Exactly where we stood
- What happened

*Well:*
- They can't really be trusted

'''

=== Why Not

*Here Is Why Not:*

*Because:*
- They are such important events
- Bet many of you have actually heard question before:
- "Where were you on September 11th?"
- Talked about it

*What Happens in These Conversations:*
- Stories change

*Personal Example:*
- Lecturer had--knew where he was on September 11th
- Wife knew where she was
- But: Spent as much time listening to her talk about it
- As spent time talking about it himself
- "And now maybe my memory is actually of her experience and not mine"

'''

=== The Temptation to Resist

*For All of These Cases:*

*Temptation You Have to Resist:*
- Saying: "Yes. I know memories can be swayed. I know they could be distorted and everything"
- "But, you see, I really am sure that happened"

*You Have to Resist That Temptation:*
- Because: There are so many cases we know
- Including tape of girls that we just saw
- Where people are entirely sure things happened
- And we know full well that they didn't exist

*Being Sure:*
- Is no guarantee that memory isn't:
- False
- Reconstructed
- Or even implanted

'''

== Part 17: Three Main Morals About Memory

=== Summary of Memory Section

*This Part of Memory Has:*
- Three main morals

'''

=== Moral 1: Many Types of Memories

*Talked About:*
- Short-term memory
- Long-term memory
- Implicit memory
- Explicit memory

*These Are:*
- Sort of separable sort of memories
- Could break one while having other one impaired

*Arguably:*
- There are brain systems dedicated to:
- Memory for faces
- Memory for everyday objects
- Memory for spatial locations

'''

=== Moral 2: Key Is Organization and Understanding

*The Key to Remembering:*
- Organization and understanding

*Introduction to X Courses:*
- Including Introduction to Psychology courses
- Among hardest courses at Yale

*Reason Why:*
- There is just lot of material that is diverse
- Have to command each aspect separately

*Easiest Courses at Yale:*
- Tend to be highfalutin seminars
- Where you kind of have enough of background
- That everything is--can be clear and understandable

*The More You Understand Something:*
- Easier you'll remember it

'''

=== Moral 3: Can't Trust Some of Your Memories

*Finally:*
- You can't trust some of your memories

'''

=== Reading Response

*Your Reading Response for This Week:*
- You have to use your powers for good and not for evil
- "Though if you manage to succeed at this I will be very impressed"

*Task:*
- Have to describe, based on lecture materials and readings
- How to implant false memory

'''

== Part 18: Question and Answer on Memory

=== Question 1: What Type of Memory Is Playing Piano?

*Student Question:*
- "What sort of memory is it when you know how to play piano?"

*Answer:*
- Very good question

*It Is Long-Term Memory:*
- Because: Might know how to do concerto or song
- Have it stored in your head
- Carry it around with you
- Will remember it year from now, two years from now
- It is long-term memory

*But:*
- Also excellent example of implicit memory
- Because: Know how to do it
- But: Could do it unconsciously without attending to it
- Not sensory
- But: As if, put it crudely, your fingers know and not your mind

'''

=== Question 2: Photographic Memory

*Student Question:*
- About photographic memory

*Answer:*

*Lot of Claims:*
- About photographic memory

*Lecturer's Understanding:*
- They do not tend to be substantiated

*Sometimes:*
- Photographic memory
- This came up when talked about autism few classes ago
- Is linked with savant-like skills
- People who have severe impairments in some ways
- May have photographic memories in others

*Not Convinced:*
- That photographic memory in sense that:
- You see something
- Take picture of it
- Hold it in memory
- Really exists

*May Be:*
- One or two case studies that suggest it might be real
- But: Thinks it's controversial

'''

=== Closing

*Okay:*
- Have guest lecturer on Wednesday
- Dean Peter Salovey will talk to us about love
