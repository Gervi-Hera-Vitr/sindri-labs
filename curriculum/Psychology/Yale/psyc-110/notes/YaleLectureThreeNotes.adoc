= PSYC 110 Lecture 3: Foundations of Psychology – Freud

== Historical Context & Significance

*Sigmund Freud (1850s–1940s)*

* Born in Austria, died in London (fled Nazis at the start of WWII)
* Most famous psychologist in history
* Known for building a comprehensive theory over decades (not for a single discovery)
* Extremely energetic and productive (also a cocaine user)
* Nominated for Nobel Prize (medicine & literature) – never won
* Controversial personality:
** Ambitious, often dishonest
** Harsh toward both friends and enemies
** Seen as a sexual renegade, threatening Christian values

== Scope of Theory

Freud proposed a *grand theory* that attempted to explain:

* Daily life
* Child development
* Mental illness
* Religion
* War
* Love
* Dreams
* Memory lapses
* Attraction and repulsion

This contrasts with most psychological theories, which are much more narrow and specialized.

== Core Theoretical Framework

=== The Unconscious Mind Structure

Freud proposed three components in constant conflict:

==== Id (present at birth)

* Primitive, animal self
* Seeks:
** Food
** Warmth
** Elimination
** Sexual satisfaction
* Operates on the *Pleasure Principle* – wants immediate gratification
* Completely unconscious and irrational
* Called a state of *“polymorphous perversity”* by Freud

==== Ego (develops early)

* The conscious self
* Operates on the *Reality Principle*
* Mediates between id and superego
* Plans how to satisfy desires or suppress them
* Source of conscious awareness

==== Superego (develops through socialization)

* Internalized parental and social rules
* Acts as conscience
* Also irrational in its own way – says “you should be ashamed”
* Not a sophisticated moral philosopher, just a harsh internal critic

*Key Point:* Most of this system is unconscious – you cannot simply introspect to see these processes.

=== Psychosexual Development Stages

==== Stage 1: Oral Stage (infancy)

* Pleasure center: mouth (sucking, chewing)
* Fixation cause: premature weaning
* Resulting “oral personality”:
** Overeating
** Smoking
** Gum chewing
** Dependency and neediness

==== Stage 2: Anal Stage (early childhood)

* Pleasure center: elimination
* Fixation cause: poor toilet training
* Resulting “anal personality”:
** Compulsive
** Obsessively clean
** Stingy
** Unwilling to “let go”

==== Stage 3: Phallic Stage (3–4 years)

* Pleasure center: genitals
* Fixation can lead to:
** Excessive masculinity
** Strong need for attention or domination

===== Oedipus Complex (in boys)

* Boy loves mother (source of comfort)
* Sees father as rival/competitor
* Fantasizes about killing father
* Believes father knows this
* Fears *castration* as punishment
* Resolution:
** Identifies with father
** Represses sexual feelings for mother

===== Electra Complex (in girls)

* Girl discovers she “lacks” a penis
* Believes she was castrated
* Experiences *penis envy*
* Turns to father (who has a penis) as love object
* Rejects mother (who is also “lacking”)
* Supposedly shapes later sexual preferences and allegiances

==== Stage 4: Latency Stage (childhood)

* Sexual feelings are repressed after Oedipal/Electra resolution
* Lasts several years

==== Stage 5: Genital Stage (puberty onward)

* Mature adult sexuality
* However, unconscious conflicts continue to operate.

== Defense Mechanisms

Normal psychological processes that keep unconscious content out of consciousness:

* *Sublimation* – Channel sexual/aggressive energy into socially acceptable outlets
(e.g., art, sports)
* *Displacement* – Redirect emotions to safer targets
(e.g., hate father → kick dog)
* *Projection* – Attribute your own unacceptable desires to others
(e.g., homophobic person projecting own impulses)
* *Rationalization* – Provide socially acceptable reasons for unacceptable behavior
(e.g., “spanking is good parenting”)
* *Regression* – Return to an earlier developmental stage under stress
(e.g., thumb sucking, crying)

== Clinical Applications

=== Hysteria (outdated term)

* Symptoms:
** Blindness
** Deafness
** Paralysis
** Trembling
** Panic attacks
** Amnesia
(with no physiological cause)
* Freud’s view: symptoms exist to prevent unconscious content from emerging.

=== Psychoanalytic Method

* Originally: hypnosis
* Later: free association
* Goal: overcome resistance and gain insight
* Theoretical claim: once the unconscious cause is understood, the symptom disappears.

== Dreams

* *Manifest content:* what you consciously experience in the dream
* *Latent content:* hidden meaning/symbolism
* Freud: *all dreams are wish fulfillment* (even forbidden wishes)
* Universal themes reflect unconscious struggles.

== Scientific Critique

=== Major Problems with Freudian Theory

==== 1. Unfalsifiability (Karl Popper’s critique)

* Theory is too vague to test.
* Predicts everything, so it can’t be proven wrong.
* Example:
** Patient agrees with interpretation → Freud is right.
** Patient disagrees → “Your resistance proves I’m right.”
* Similar issue with astrology vs. real science (which can be disproven).

==== 2. Lack of Empirical Support

* No strong evidence that:
** Oral/anal personalities correspond to weaning/toilet training history.
* Cross-cultural data:
** No consistent link between child-rearing practices and Freud’s predicted adult personality outcomes.
* Freud’s theories about homosexuality are unsupported.
* Psychoanalysis is not more effective than other treatments for mental disorders.

==== 3. Validation Problems

* You cannot validate the theory simply through psychoanalysis (circular reasoning).
* When Freud’s ideas are tested via specific predictions, they often fail.

=== Current Status

* Rarely studied in psychology departments as *current* theory.
* More common in:
** History departments
** Literature departments
* Few modern psychologists identify as Freudian practitioners.
* Psychoanalytic practice continues mostly outside academic psychology.

== Valid Contributions (Modern Psychology Support)

=== The Dynamic Unconscious Survives

Modern evidence supports the idea of unconscious processes:

* *Language processing* – automatic parsing of sentences without awareness.
* *Automatic behaviors* – driving, tying shoes, etc., without conscious control.
* *Preferences shaped unconsciously:*
** Initiation effect: the harder you work for something, the more you like it.
** Price effect: the more you pay, the more you value it.
** Cognitive ease: the easier it is to list reasons, the stronger your preference feels.
* *Terror management studies:* subliminal death-related words increase nationalism and decrease tolerance.
* *Racial/sexual prejudice:* people hold implicit attitudes they’re unaware of and can’t easily control.

=== Schwarz Experiment (lecture example)

* Group 1:
** List 3 positive features of a loved one → increased liking.
* Group 2:
** List 10 positive features → decreased liking.
* Interpretation:
** Difficulty generating 10 reasons makes people doubt their feelings.
** People are unaware that the *task difficulty* influenced their ratings.

== Historical Impact

Freud’s ideas have reshaped our worldview so deeply that we forget how things looked before:

* We now take for granted:
** Unconscious motivation
** Childhood shaping adult personality
** Symbolic meaning of actions and symptoms
* Freud is a *“victim of his own success”* – his concepts are so integrated that we rarely credit him explicitly.

== Lecture Questions Addressed

* *Single-parent families:*
Freud’s theory was built around upper-class European nuclear families – it fits poorly with many modern family structures.
* *Women and the superego:*
Freud believed women had weaker superegos than men (a view now seen as highly problematic and sexist).
* *Cross-cultural variation:*
Little evidence that his psychosexual stages apply universally across cultures.
* *Medication:*
Freud thought talk therapy was superior; many modern psychoanalysts argue drugs mask symptoms rather than addressing root causes.
