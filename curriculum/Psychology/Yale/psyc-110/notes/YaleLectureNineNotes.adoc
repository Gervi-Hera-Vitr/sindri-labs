== Defining Love: Sternberg's Triangular Theory

Robert Sternberg (former Yale faculty, later Dean of Tufts) proposed that love consists of *three required components*:

=== The Three Components

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Component |Definition |Operational Meaning

|*Intimacy*
|Feeling of closeness, connectedness, bonding
|Sharing secrets/information you don't share with others

|*Passion*
|The drive that leads to romance
|Physical attraction, sexual arousal

|*Commitment*
|Decision that one is in a love relationship
|Willingness to label it as love + desire to maintain it
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
According to Sternberg: It's not love if you don't have all three elements. It's also not love if you don't *call* it love.
====

=== Permutations: What You Get With Different Combinations

==== Zero Components
* *Non-love* - The relationship you have with a random stranger

==== One Component Only

[cols="1,1,1,1,2"]
|===
|Type |Intimacy |Passion |Commitment |Description

|*Liking*
|✓
|✗
|✗
|Casual friendships - closeness without attraction or commitment

|*Infatuation*
|✗
|✓
|✗
|"Love at first sight" - pure physical attraction, no knowledge of person, no future thinking

|*Empty Love*
|✗
|✗
|✓
|Commitment without intimacy or passion
|===

*Empty Love* is particularly interesting:

* Often the *final stage* of long-term relationships gone bad ("staying together for the kids")
* In arranged marriage societies, often the *first stage* - commitment exists before anything else
* Arranged marriages don't have higher divorce rates, BUT confound: they occur in societies that make divorce socially costly

==== Two Components ("Two Out of Three Ain't Bad" - Meat Loaf)

[cols="1,1,1,1,2"]
|===
|Type |Intimacy |Passion |Commitment |Description

|*Romantic Love*
|✓
|✓
|✗
|Physical attraction + close bonding, but no commitment. Romeo & Juliet when they first met. Won't use the "L word."

|*Companionate Love*
|✓
|✗
|✓
|Best friendship - committed to sharing intimacy forever, but no physical attraction. The Greek ideal.

|*Fatuous Love*
|✗
|✓
|✓
|Whirlwind courtship, Hollywood romance, Vegas wedding. "Committed to each other for sex." Hard to sustain - may have nothing in common.

==== Three Components
* *Consummate Love* - Complete love. The full package.

== The Social Psychology of Attraction

Research has focused more on *attraction* (what draws people together initially) than love itself. Seven key variables identified, divided into two groups.

=== The Big Three (Obvious, Powerful Effects)

The phrase to understand these: *"All other things being equal..."*

==== 1. Proximity (Spatial Closeness)

People physically closer together are more likely to form romantic relationships.

*Evidence:*

* Manhattan studies: Correlation between city blocks separating people's doors and likelihood of romantic relationship
* College campus studies: Negative correlation between feet separating dorm room doors and relationship formation

*Cultural myth contradiction:* We romanticize "the stranger" - but statistically, it's the person nearby you'll fall for.

==== 2. Similarity

On *any dimension* psychologists have measured, more similar people are more attracted to each other.

* Obvious: height, age
* Less obvious: attitudes toward capital punishment, sports team preferences

*Common sayings evaluated:*

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Saying |Evidence?

|"Opposites attract"
|*No* - little evidence

|"Similarity breeds contempt"
|*No* - little evidence

|"Birds of a feather flock together"
|*Yes* - supported
|===

==== 3. Familiarity

We fall in love with people we already know, not strangers.

*"Some Enchanted Evening"* (South Pacific) - seeing a stranger across a crowded room - is a cultural myth, not the statistical norm.

*The Mere Exposure Effect:*

* Works even for non-human stimuli
* Flash words in an unfamiliar language very quickly
* Later, mix those words with new ones
* People prefer the words they saw before - even if they don't remember seeing them
* Works even with subliminal exposure

---

=== The More Interesting Four (Subtle Effects)

==== 1. The Pratfall Effect

*Core finding:* Our liking for a competent person *increases* when they make a mistake.

*Why it matters:*

* We're attracted to competent people over incompetent ones (obvious)
* BUT super-competent people are threatening - they diminish us by comparison
* The competent person who occasionally blunders becomes *more* attractive

*The Classic Experiment (Elliot Aronson):*

Participants listen to tape recordings of "College Bowl" quiz show candidates:

*Nearly Perfect Person:*

* 92% correct answers
* Member of campus honor society
* Editor of yearbook
* Ran varsity track

*Mediocre Person:*

* 30% correct answers
* Average grades
* Yearbook proofreader
* Tried out for track, didn't make it

*The Blunder Condition:*

Half of participants hear additional audio: clattering dishes, person saying "Oh my goodness, I've spilled coffee all over my new suit."

*Results:*

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Person Type |No Blunder |With Blunder

|Competent
|Attractive
|*Even MORE attractive*

|Mediocre
|Less attractive
|*Even LESS attractive*
|===

*Sad irony:* The effect works both ways. Blundering only helps if you're already seen as competent.

*Real-world example:* Bill Clinton's popularity didn't suffer much after the Lewinsky scandal - "It just shows he's human."

==== 2. Physical Attractiveness

*The uncomfortable truth:* We say looks don't matter, but they do.

*Survey vs. Reality:*

When surveyed, college students say these matter:

* Warmth ✓
* Sensitivity ✓
* Intelligence ✓
* Compassion ✓
* Sense of humor ✓
* Looks ✗ (they say it doesn't matter)

*Blind date studies:* The ONLY significant predictor of getting a second date was *physical attractiveness*.

*University of Minnesota "Computer Dance" study:*

* Students randomly paired by computer algorithm
* Extensive data collected on all participants
* Only predictor of continuing the relationship: rating partner as attractive

*The "Frizzy Wig" Experiment (Aronson):*

Setup: Naturally attractive female confederate interviews male participants, made to look either attractive or unattractive (frumpy clothes, bad makeup, frizzy wig). Gives them personality evaluations (favorable or unfavorable).

*Results:*

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Confederate Appearance |Feedback Type |Participant Response

|Attractive
|Positive
|Delighted

|Attractive
|Negative
|Really upset; sought future interaction to prove evaluation wrong

|Unattractive
|Either
|*Didn't care* - feedback had no impact
|===

*Implication:* Feedback from attractive people has more psychological impact on us.

==== 3. Gain-Loss Effect

*Core principle:* We are wired to be more sensitive to *change* than to steady states (change signals danger or opportunity - evolutionary advantage).

*The Gain Effect:*

* Not most powerful: Someone who always loves you ("I love you, I love you, I love you...")
* Most powerful: Someone whose regard for you is *increasing over time*
* Even if their average regard is lower (started low, went high), the positive trajectory captures attention
* *The first derivative matters more than the absolute position*

*The Loss Effect:*

* Not most hurtful: Someone who has always been negative (constant hostility loses power to hurt)
* Most hurtful: Someone who was positive but whose regard is *fading*

"Nothing can hurt you like the person you love" - Ricky Skaggs

* You can only hurt the one you love because you *expect* positive feedback from them
* When that turns negative, it's devastating

==== 4. Misattribution of Arousal

*Core concept:* You feel physiologically aroused but aren't sure why → you make up an explanation → sometimes that explanation is wrong → you think it's love when it's something else.

*The Starbucks Thought Experiment:*

. You're on a date, order decaf for your companion
. Barista accidentally uses caffeinated espresso
. Walking home at 1am, companion feels: rapid heartbeat, sweaty palms, shorter breath
. She thinks: "I ordered decaf, so it can't be coffee..."
. She looks at you: "What a rare mood I'm in. It's almost like being in love."
. Reality: Two shots of caffeine. Misattributed as romantic attraction.

*The "Rickety Bridge" Field Experiment (University of British Columbia):*

Two ways to cross a river on campus:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Bridge Type |Characteristics

|Rickety Bridge
|Rope bridge, hundreds of feet up, sways in breeze, 3 feet wide, scary

|Solid Bridge
|Low, near water, solid wood planks, wide, safe
|===

Attractive female confederate intercepts men after crossing, asks questions, collects a story they write, gives her phone number.

*Results:*

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Bridge |Story Content |Called Her Later?

|Rickety
|Sexy, ribald themes
|More likely

|Solid
|Boring
|Less likely
|===

*Interpretation:* Fear arousal from rickety bridge misattributed as attraction to the woman.

*CRITICAL FLAW:* This is *not* a true experiment - no random assignment. People who choose the rickety bridge may be adventure-seekers who would naturally write sexy stories and call strangers. Selection bias.

*Laboratory Experiments (with random assignment):*

*Painful Shock Study:*

* Control: "Please wait here. Fill out forms rating experimenter's attractiveness."
* Experimental: "Please wait here. The painful shock experiment will begin shortly. Fill out forms."
* Result: Shock condition rated experimenter as more attractive (anticipatory arousal misattributed)

*Treadmill Study:*

* Control: Wait and fill out forms
* Experimental: Run on treadmill for 10 minutes, then fill out forms
* Result: Exercise condition rated experimenter more attractive
* Effect persists even when arousal source is obvious

====

*The Fake Heartbeat Study:*

* Male subjects view Playboy centerfolds
* Wearing headphones supposedly amplifying their heartbeat
* Asked which centerfold they find most attractive
* *Twist:* Not actually hearing their heartbeat - hearing a tape recording
* Experimenter randomly speeds up the "heartbeat" at different slides
* Result: Whichever slide played during fast heartbeat = rated most attractive
* *You can misattribute arousal that isn't even real*

=== Serious Implications: Domestic Violence

Why do people stay in abusive relationships?

*#1 Reason:* Economic - belief there's no alternative (homelessness, children's welfare)

*#2 Reason:* Misattribution of arousal

* Emotional/psychological abuse: screaming, name-calling, fights
* Creates physiological arousal
* Misattributed as love: "He wouldn't be yelling at me if he didn't love me"
* Fear misattributed as mutual attraction

*Real example:* Woman whose boyfriend punched out her car window while yelling at her. Her response: "That's when I knew he really loved me."

* His aggression → misattributed as love
* Her fear → misattributed as mutual attraction

---

== Key Methodological Points

=== Limitations Noted

. Many classic experiments can't be replicated today - ethical standards have changed
. Much research has androcentric and heterosexual bias (male participants, female targets)
. Question to always ask: Do findings generalize to other dyadic relationships?

=== Experiment vs. Non-Experiment

*True experiment requires:* Random assignment to conditions

*Rickety Bridge study flaw:* Participants self-selected which bridge to cross → can't establish causation

== Summary Table: Attraction Variables

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Variable |Effect |Key Insight

|Proximity
|Closer = more attracted
|It's not the stranger you fall for

|Similarity
|More similar = more attracted
|Opposites don't actually attract

|Familiarity
|More familiar = more attracted
|Works even with subliminal exposure

|Pratfall
|Blunders increase liking for competent people
|Only works if already seen as competent

|Physical Attractiveness
|Attractive = more influence, more second dates
|We deny it matters, but it does

|Gain-Loss
|Increasing regard > constant regard
|First derivative matters more than position

|Misattribution
|Arousal from any source can be mistaken for attraction
|Even fake/obvious arousal can be misattributed

== Discussion Questions Raised

. Can someone feel consummate love for more than one person?
** Evolutionary perspective: Yes - facilitates genetic diversity
** Social construction: Most societies say no - creates conflict
** Result: Probably possible, but conflicted

. Do the Big Three affect relationship maintenance or just initial attraction?
** Literature mostly focuses on initial attraction
** Hard to follow couples over time without interference (Heisenberg-esque problem)

. Wouldn't natural selection favor people who learn and apply this knowledge?
** Would require designing a proclivity for learning this material
** Would make social psychologists very happy if true
