Neurons are the fundamental signaling units of the nervous system, transmitting information through a combination of electrical and chemical processes. A typical neuron receives input from *thousands of other neurons* through its dendrites, integrates these signals at the axon hillock, and—if threshold is crossed—fires an action potential that travels at speeds up to *150 m/s* along myelinated axons. This document covers neuronal architecture, the biophysics of electrical signaling, synaptic transmission, and the plasticity mechanisms underlying learning and memory.

== Neuron Structure

=== Dendrites: The Input Antennae

Dendrites form elaborate tree-like branching structures that expand the neuron's receptive surface. A large cortical pyramidal cell can receive signals from approximately *30,000 presynaptic neurons* through its dendritic arbor.

==== Dendritic Spines

Tiny protrusions (*0.2–2.0 μm* in length) that serve as primary sites for excitatory synaptic input.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Spine Type |Characteristics

|Mushroom
|Large bulbous head; mature, stable synapses

|Thin
|Small head, elongated neck; "learning spines" capable of rapid modification

|Stubby
|No distinct neck; connects directly to shaft

|Filopodial
|Long, thin; immature, often lacks postsynaptic density
|===

Spine density: *1–10 spines per μm* along dendrites

The spine tip contains the *postsynaptic density (PSD)*—an electron-dense region packed with:

* Glutamate receptors (AMPA, NMDA)
* Scaffolding proteins (PSD-95, Shank, Homer)
* Kinases and phosphatases
* Ion channels

=== Soma: The Metabolic Center

The cell body contains the nucleus and protein-synthesizing machinery.

Soma diameter:: 5–140 μm (varies by neuron type)

Nucleus:: Large, spherical, euchromatic with prominent nucleolus

Nissl bodies:: Aggregations of rough ER and polyribosomes; found in soma and dendrites but *absent from axon*—a key distinguishing feature

NOTE: The brain consumes ~20% of body oxygen despite being only ~2% of body weight.

=== Axon Hillock and Initial Segment

The *axon initial segment (AIS)* extends 10–60 μm from the soma and serves as the "trigger zone" for action potentials.

.Why the AIS Has the Lowest Threshold
[sidebar]
****
Channel density comparison:

* Cell body: ~1 Na⁺ channel per μm²
* AIS: *100–200 Na⁺ channels per μm²*

This 50-fold increase ensures reliable action potential initiation.
****

The master scaffolding protein *ankyrinG* organizes this structure by anchoring:

* Sodium channels (Nav1.2, Nav1.6)
* Potassium channels
* Cell adhesion molecules

=== The Axon: Long-Distance Transmission

Axon length:: Few mm (local interneurons) to >1 meter (motor neurons to foot)

Axon diameter:: <1 μm to 20 μm in human peripheral nerves

==== Axonal Transport

Since protein synthesis occurs mainly in the soma, neurons use molecular motors to transport materials.

[cols="1,1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Type |Speed |Cargo |Motor

|Fast anterograde
|50–400 mm/day
|Vesicles, mitochondria
|Kinesin (toward + end)

|Fast retrograde
|50–400 mm/day
|Signaling endosomes, degradation cargo
|Dynein (toward − end)

|Slow
|0.1–6 mm/day
|Cytoskeletal proteins, enzymes
|Multiple mechanisms
|===

=== Myelin Sheath: The Speed Multiplier

Myelin is a multilayered membrane wrapping that enables rapid signal transmission.

Composition:: *70–80% lipid* by dry weight (vs 30–50% for typical membranes)

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Location |Myelinating Cell |Ratio

|CNS
|Oligodendrocyte
|One cell → 40–60 axon segments

|PNS
|Schwann cell
|One cell → one axon segment
|===

==== Nodes of Ranvier

Unmyelinated gaps (~1 μm wide) between myelin segments where the axon membrane is exposed.

Node channel density:: *1,000–2,000 Na⁺ channels per μm²*

==== Saltatory Conduction

Latin "saltare" = to jump

Rather than continuously depolarizing, current flows passively through axoplasm under myelin, then regenerates at each node.

Benefits:

* Speed: Up to *150 m/s* (vs 0.5–10 m/s unmyelinated)
* Energy efficiency: Fewer ions cross membrane, less pump activity needed

=== Axon Terminals: Release Sites

The synaptic bouton contains the machinery for neurotransmitter release.

==== Synaptic Vesicles

Small membrane spheres (*40–80 nm* diameter) storing neurotransmitters.

[cols="1,2,1", options="header"]
|===
|Pool |Function |% of Total

|Readily releasable (RRP)
|Docked, primed for immediate release
|1–2%

|Recycling
|Mobilized during moderate activity
|10–20%

|Reserve
|Tethered by synapsins; recruited during intense activity
|80–90%
|===

== Electrical Signaling

=== Resting Membrane Potential

The resting potential of *−70 mV* results from unequal ion distribution plus selective membrane permeability.

==== Ion Concentrations

[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Ion |Inside |Outside |Gradient Direction

|K⁺
|120–140 mM
|4–5 mM
|Out (30:1)

|Na⁺
|10–14 mM
|140 mM
|In (1:14)

|Cl⁻
|4–10 mM
|110 mM
|In (1:11)

|Ca²⁺
|0.0001 mM
|1–2 mM
|In (>10,000:1)
|===

==== Equilibrium Potentials

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Ion |E_ion

|K⁺
|−90 mV

|Na⁺
|+60 mV

|Cl⁻
|−70 to −80 mV
|===

==== The Sodium-Potassium Pump

The Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase actively maintains gradients:

* Pumps *3 Na⁺ out* for every *2 K⁺ in*
* Consumes *20–40% of neuronal ATP* at rest
* Contributes ~−4 mV directly (electrogenic)

At rest, membrane is *50–100× more permeable to K⁺ than Na⁺*, pulling potential toward E_K.

=== Graded Potentials

Changes in membrane voltage that vary with stimulus strength.

EPSP (Excitatory):: Depolarization (~0.5–1 mV per synapse); Na⁺ influx through AMPA receptors

IPSP (Inhibitory):: Hyperpolarization; Cl⁻ influx through GABA_A receptors

Key properties:

* Spread *passively* (electrotonically)
* Decay with distance (length constant λ = 0.1–5 mm)
* Decay with time (time constant τ = 10–100 ms)
* *Cannot transmit long distances*—hence the need for action potentials

=== The Action Potential

A rapid, stereotyped, all-or-none change in membrane potential.

==== Phases

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Phase |Duration |Mechanism

|Depolarization
|~0.5–1 ms
|Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels open; Na⁺ rushes in; positive feedback

|Peak
|—
|Membrane reaches +30 to +40 mV (approaches but doesn't reach E_Na)

|Repolarization
|~1 ms
|Na⁺ channels inactivate; K⁺ channels open; K⁺ exits

|Hyperpolarization
|~1–2 ms
|K⁺ channels still open; membrane approaches E_K (−80 to −90 mV)
|===

==== All-or-None Principle

Action potentials fire at full amplitude or not at all. Information about stimulus intensity is encoded in *firing frequency*, not amplitude.

==== Refractory Periods

Absolute (1–2 ms):: Na⁺ channels inactivated; *no stimulus can trigger another AP*

Relative (2–4 ms):: Na⁺ channels recovering; *stronger stimulus required*

Maximum firing rate: ~500–1000 Hz (limited by refractories)

Typical sustained rates: 10–200 Hz

=== Ion Channels

==== Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels

Structure:: Large α-subunit (~260 kDa) with four domains (I–IV), each having six transmembrane segments

Voltage sensor:: S4 segment with positively charged residues; moves outward during depolarization

Inactivation:: III–IV linker (IFM motif) swings into pore

==== Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels

Structure:: Tetramers of separate α-subunits

Kinetics:: ~10× slower than Na⁺ channels (hence "delayed rectifier")

==== Selectivity

The *selectivity filter* achieves remarkable discrimination:

* K⁺ channels: Backbone carbonyls match hydrated K⁺ size
* Selectivity ratio: *10,000:1* (K⁺ over Na⁺)
* Single channel conductance: up to *100 million ions/second*

=== Propagation

==== Unmyelinated Axons

* Continuous conduction
* Velocity: *0.5–10 m/s*
* Increases with √(diameter)

==== Myelinated Axons (Saltatory)

* Current jumps node to node
* Velocity: *80–150 m/s*
* Increases linearly with diameter

|===

== Chemical Signaling (Synaptic Transmission)

=== Presynaptic Events

==== Calcium Entry

Action potential depolarizes terminal → opens *voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels* (CaV2.1, CaV2.2)

Calcium rises from ~50–100 nM to *10–100 μM* in microdomains near release sites within ~0.5 ms

==== Vesicle Fusion: The SNARE Complex

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Protein |Location |Role

|Synaptobrevin (VAMP)
|Vesicle membrane
|v-SNARE

|Syntaxin-1
|Plasma membrane
|t-SNARE

|SNAP-25
|Plasma membrane
|t-SNARE
|===

These proteins "zipper" together, forcing membranes close.

*Munc13*:: Opens syntaxin, enables SNARE assembly

*Munc18*:: Templates and proofreads assembly

*Complexin*:: Holds complex in cocked state

*Synaptotagmin-1*:: Calcium sensor; Ca²⁺ binding triggers fusion

Only *2–3 SNARE complexes* needed per vesicle fusion.

==== Quantal Release

Neurotransmitters released in discrete packets (single vesicles).

Release probability: *0.1–0.3* at central synapses (most APs release 0–2 vesicles)

=== The Synaptic Cleft

Width:: 20–30 nm (central synapses)

Peak glutamate concentration:: ~1.1 mM

Clearance time constant:: ~1.2 ms

==== Termination Mechanisms

. *Enzymatic degradation* (e.g., acetylcholinesterase: ~5,000 molecules/sec)
. *Reuptake transporters* (DAT, SERT, NET, GATs, EAATs)
. *Diffusion* out of cleft

=== Postsynaptic Receptors

==== Ionotropic (Ligand-Gated Ion Channels)

Fast responses (milliseconds)

[cols="1,2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Receptor |Ion Permeability |Effect |Notes

|AMPA
|Na⁺, K⁺ (Ca²⁺ if lacking GluA2)
|EPSP
|Fast excitation

|NMDA
|Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺
|EPSP + Ca²⁺ signal
|Coincidence detector (requires depolarization to relieve Mg²⁺ block)

|GABA_A
|Cl⁻
|IPSP
|Fast inhibition; benzodiazepine binding site
|===

==== Metabotropic (G-Protein Coupled)

Slower responses (100s of ms to seconds)

*cAMP pathway*:: Gs → adenylyl cyclase → cAMP → PKA

*IP3/DAG pathway*:: Gq → phospholipase C → IP3 (Ca²⁺ release) + DAG (PKC activation)

=== Major Neurotransmitter Systems

==== Glutamate (Principal Excitatory)

* Used at ~50% of CNS synapses
* Vesicle concentration: 60–210 mM (~2,000–3,000 molecules/vesicle)
* Clearance: EAAT transporters into astrocytes → glutamine synthetase → glutamine recycling

==== GABA (Principal Inhibitory)

* Synthesized from glutamate by GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase)
* GABA_A: Fast Cl⁻-mediated inhibition
* GABA_B: Slow K⁺-mediated inhibition (metabotropic)
* GABAergic interneurons: 20–40% of CNS neurons

==== Dopamine

* Synthesized: Tyrosine → L-DOPA (rate-limiting: tyrosine hydroxylase) → Dopamine
* D1-like (D1, D5): Gs → ↑cAMP
* D2-like (D2, D3, D4): Gi → ↓cAMP
* Functions: Reward, motivation, motor control, working memory

==== Serotonin (5-HT)

* Produced by raphe nuclei
* 14+ receptor subtypes
* 5-HT3: Only ionotropic serotonin receptor
* Functions: Mood, sleep, appetite, cognition

==== Acetylcholine

* Neuromuscular junction, autonomic synapses, cortical arousal
* Nicotinic: Ionotropic (pentamer)
* Muscarinic (M1–M5): Metabotropic
* Cleared by *enzymatic degradation* (acetylcholinesterase), not reuptake

==== Norepinephrine

* Produced by locus coeruleus
* α1 (Gq): Excitatory
* α2 (Gi): Inhibitory autoreceptors
* β (Gs): Generally excitatory
* Functions: Arousal, attention, stress response

=== Excitation vs Inhibition

EPSPs:: Depolarize toward ~0 mV reversal potential → approach threshold

IPSPs:: Hyperpolarize toward −70 to −90 mV → move away from threshold

*Shunting inhibition*:: GABA_A channels open near rest, increasing conductance and "short-circuiting" EPSPs without obvious hyperpolarization

IMPORTANT: Proper E/I balance is critical. Excitatory synapses outnumber inhibitory ~4:1, but inhibition is powerful and precisely timed. Disrupted balance → seizures (excess excitation) or dysfunction (excess inhibition).

== Signal Integration

=== Spatial Summation

EPSPs and IPSPs from *different synapses* arriving simultaneously are summed algebraically at the axon hillock.

* Proximal synapses (near soma) exert greater influence
* Signals decay with distance (length constant)

Example: A motor neuron receives ~10,000 contacts (2,000 on soma, 8,000 on dendrites)

=== Temporal Summation

Successive inputs from the *same synapse* arriving faster than the membrane time constant can summate.

* Membrane τ: 10–30 ms
* EPSP duration: 15–20 ms
* Inputs within this window can add together

=== The Decision

When combined EPSPs − IPSPs depolarizes the AIS to threshold (~−55 mV):

. High Na⁺ channel density ensures reliable AP initiation
. Firing rate encodes stimulus intensity (rate coding)

== Synaptic Plasticity

=== Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)

Persistent strengthening of synaptic transmission lasting hours to weeks.

First discovered by Terje Lømo (1966); published with Tim Bliss (1973).

==== NMDA Receptors as Coincidence Detectors

At rest, Mg²⁺ blocks the NMDA receptor pore.

Opening requires *both*:

. Glutamate binding (presynaptic activity)
. Postsynaptic depolarization (relieves Mg²⁺ block)

This ensures only synapses active when the postsynaptic neuron fires are strengthened.

==== Molecular Cascade

. Ca²⁺ enters through NMDA receptors
. Ca²⁺ binds *calmodulin*
. Calmodulin activates *CaMKII*
. CaMKII *autophosphorylates* → becomes constitutively active

==== Early vs Late LTP

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Phase |Duration |Mechanism

|Early LTP
|1–2 hours
|AMPA receptor trafficking and phosphorylation; no new protein synthesis

|Late LTP
|Hours to days
|CREB activation, gene transcription, new protein synthesis, structural changes
|===

==== Induction Protocols

* High-frequency stimulation: 100 Hz for 1 second
* Theta-burst stimulation: Bursts of 4–5 pulses at 100 Hz, repeated at 5 Hz

=== Long-Term Depression (LTD)

Weakening of synaptic connections.

Induction:: Low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz for 10–15 min, ~900 pulses)

Mechanism:: Modest Ca²⁺ increase preferentially activates *phosphatases* (calcineurin, PP1) rather than kinases

Result:: AMPA receptor internalization and dephosphorylation

Function::
* Memory refinement (weakening inappropriate connections)
* Prevents saturation
* Allows memory updating

=== Hebbian Plasticity and STDP

Donald Hebb (1949): Connections strengthen when presynaptic activity repeatedly contributes to postsynaptic firing.

*Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)*:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Timing |Result

|Pre → Post (1–20 ms)
|LTP (input "contributed to" firing)

|Post → Pre
|LTD (input arrived "too late")
|===

Critical window: ±20–40 ms

"Neurons that fire together wire together"

=== Structural Plasticity

LTP triggers physical changes:

* Spine volume increase: Up to *200–390%* within 5–7 minutes
* Stabilizes at ~40–50% larger
* New spine formation from dendritic shafts

LTD triggers:

* Spine shrinkage
* Eventual elimination (pruning, partly mediated by microglia)

==== Actin Dynamics

~95% of spine F-actin turns over every ~40 seconds.

LTP activates:

* *Cofilin* (severs existing filaments)
* *Arp2/3 complex* (nucleates new branched filaments)

Result: Net polymerization → membrane pushed outward → spine enlargement

==== BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)

Essential for structural and functional plasticity.

* Released activity-dependently
* Binds TrkB receptors
* Activates PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, PLCγ pathways
* Promotes spine growth, dendritic arborization, late-phase LTP

BDNF increases with: Learning, exercise

BDNF decreases with: Aging, neurodegeneration, chronic stress

== Neuron Classification

=== By Structure

[cols="1,2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Type |Processes |Prevalence |Examples

|Multipolar
|Multiple dendrites + 1 axon
|~99% of neurons
|Motor neurons, pyramidal cells, Purkinje cells

|Bipolar
|1 dendrite + 1 axon (opposite sides)
|Specialized sensory
|Retinal bipolar cells, olfactory neurons

|Pseudo-unipolar
|Single process that splits (T-shape)
|Sensory ganglia
|Dorsal root ganglion neurons
|===

=== By Function

Sensory (afferent):: Carry information toward CNS (mechanoreceptors, nociceptors, photoreceptors)

Motor (efferent):: Carry commands to muscles/glands

* Alpha motor neurons: 60–120 m/s; innervate force-generating muscle fibers
* Gamma motor neurons: 4–24 m/s; innervate muscle spindles

Interneurons:: Process and integrate information within CNS; comprise >99% of all neurons (~20 billion)

=== Specialized Types

Purkinje cells:: Cerebellar cortex; soma ~80 μm; elaborate candelabra-shaped dendrites; receives ~200,000 parallel fiber inputs; sole cerebellar cortex output (GABAergic)

Pyramidal cells:: Cortex and hippocampus; cone-shaped soma ~20 μm; prominent apical dendrite; 70–90% of cortical neurons; form long-range connections

Cerebellar granule cells:: Most numerous neurons (~50 billion); tiny soma (~10 μm); send parallel fibers through molecular layer

Chandelier cells:: GABAergic interneurons; synapse exclusively on axon initial segment of pyramidal neurons; powerful control over AP generation

== Pathology

=== Demyelinating Diseases

==== Multiple Sclerosis

Prevalence: ~1 in 500–1,000 adults (North America); more common in women

Mechanism:: Autoimmune attack on CNS myelin; T cells and B cells target myelin antigens

Effects of demyelination::
* Conduction velocity drops from ~60 m/s to *<5 m/s*
* Complete *conduction block* possible
* Signal desynchronization → tremor, ataxia

Uhthoff's phenomenon:: Worsening symptoms with heat (elevated temperature further impairs demyelinated conduction)

Remyelination challenges::

* Oligodendrocyte precursors may not fully differentiate
* Chronic inflammation creates hostile environment
* Astrocytic scarring (gliosis) forms barriers
* Successful remyelination produces thinner myelin with shorter internodes

=== Channelopathies

Diseases caused by ion channel mutations.

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
|Gene |Channel |Disease

|SCN1A
|Nav1.1
|Dravet syndrome (severe infantile epilepsy)

|KCNQ2/3
|M-type K⁺
|Benign familial neonatal convulsions

|SCN4A
|Muscle Nav1.4
|Periodic paralysis

|CLCN1
|Muscle Cl⁻
|Myotonia congenita

|KCNQ1, KCNH2
|Cardiac K⁺
|Long QT syndrome
|===

NOTE: SCN1A is primarily expressed in inhibitory interneurons; loss-of-function reduces inhibition → hyperexcitability.

=== Neurodegenerative Diseases

Common themes across diseases:

* Protein aggregation
* Selective neuronal vulnerability
* Mitochondrial dysfunction
* Oxidative stress
* *Synaptic loss precedes cell death*

==== Alzheimer's Disease

Pathological hallmarks::
* *Amyloid plaques*: Extracellular Aβ (especially Aβ42)
* *Neurofibrillary tangles*: Intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau

Progression:: Begins in entorhinal cortex/hippocampus → spreads to association cortices

Key finding:: Synaptic loss correlates most closely with cognitive decline

==== Parkinson's Disease

Pathology:: Loss of dopaminergic neurons in *substantia nigra pars compacta*

Critical threshold:: *80% of nigral neurons lost* before clinical symptoms appear

Lewy bodies:: Intracellular α-synuclein aggregates

Symptoms:: Tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia (from disrupted basal ganglia circuitry)

==== Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

Affected:: Both upper (cortex) and lower (spinal cord/brainstem) motor neurons

TDP-43:: Aggregates found in ~97% of cases (normally involved in RNA processing)

Selective vulnerability:: Alpha motor neurons degenerate; gamma motor neurons spared

==== Vicious Cycle

. Protein misfolding
. Soluble oligomers form (often most toxic)
. Growth into protofibrils and amyloid fibrils
. Mitochondrial dysfunction → ↓ATP, ↑ROS
. Oxidative damage promotes further misfolding

== Key Takeaways

[IMPORTANT]
====
. *Electrical signals* (action potentials) travel within neurons; *chemical signals* (neurotransmitters) travel between neurons

. The *all-or-none* action potential encodes information in *firing frequency*, not amplitude

. *Myelination* increases conduction velocity from ~1 m/s to ~150 m/s—a 150× improvement

. *NMDA receptors* are coincidence detectors requiring both presynaptic activity AND postsynaptic depolarization—the basis for Hebbian learning

. *Structural plasticity* means your brain physically changes shape as you learn—spines grow, shrink, form, and are eliminated based on experience

. The molecular basis of memory involves CaMKII autophosphorylation, AMPA receptor trafficking, and BDNF-dependent gene expression
