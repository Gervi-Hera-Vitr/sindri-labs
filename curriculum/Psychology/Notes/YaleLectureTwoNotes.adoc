= Introduction to Psychology: The Brain, Mind, and Dualism
Professor Paul Bloom – Chapter 1–5 Notes

== 1. The Astonishing Hypothesis (Francis Crick)

*Core Claim:*
"You, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules."

*Translation:* You're nothing but a pack of neurons.

*Why It's Astonishing:*
This view contradicts human intuition and nearly all religious or philosophical traditions throughout history.

== 2. Dualism: The Traditional View

=== What Is Dualism?

Dualism is the belief that humans consist of two separate kinds of things:

* Physical material bodies
* Immaterial minds/souls

*Key Proponent:* René Descartes

=== Descartes’ Position

*Animals:* Biological robots (“beast machines”) with no immaterial soul.
*Humans:* Possess both physical bodies *and* immaterial souls that:

* Reside *in* physical bodies
* Are separate *from* physical bodies
* Can exist without the physical body

== 3. Descartes’ Arguments for Dualism

=== Argument #1: Human Capabilities Beyond Machines

* Robots of his era could do reflexive actions.
* Human bodies also have reflexes.
* Humans, however, can:
** Speak creatively
** Choose freely
** Coordinate complex behavior

*Conclusion:* Humans cannot be mere machines.

=== Argument #2: The Method of Doubt

Descartes doubted nearly everything:

* Existence of God
* Having a body
* Being awake
* Not being deceived (evil demon / The Matrix-style)

But he *could not* doubt:

*He was thinking.*

*Conclusion:*
Cogito ergo sum — “I think, therefore I am.”
Thus the mind (thinking substance) is separate from the physical body.

== 4. Evidence of Dualism in Common Sense

=== Embedded in Language
We say:

* “My body”
* “My brain”

as if they are possessions instead of identity.

=== Intuitions About Personal Identity

People imagine identity preserved across radical bodily changes:

* Body-swap movies
* Reincarnation
* Kafka’s *Metamorphosis*
* *Odyssey* companions turned into pigs but minds remain

=== Multiple Personalities / Possession

Widespread beliefs:

* Several people in one body
* Spirits taking control

=== Survival After Death

Nearly all cultures believe the self survives bodily death.
Survey results:
96% of Christians — “I’m going to Heaven.”
Even many non-religious people believe the same.

== 5. Scientific Consensus Against Dualism

=== The Modern View
*The mind is what the brain does.*
No self independent of the brain.

=== Problems With Dualism

1. **Unscientific:** Explains nothing, can’t address language learning, mental illness, emotional responses.
2. **Connection Problem:** No explanation for how a nonphysical soul interacts with a physical body.
3. **Physical Things Can Be Complex:** Modern computers can play chess, recognize patterns, compute, etc.
4. **Brain–Mind Correlation:**
* Brain damage → mental changes
* Drugs → mental changes
* Brain imaging → specific regions for vision, sound, language, moral reasoning

== 6. The Neuron: Basic Building Blocks

=== Structure of a Neuron

* *Dendrites:* Receive excitatory (+) or inhibitory (−) signals
* *Cell Body:* Sums signals; fires at threshold (~+60)
* *Axon:* Sends signals; often insulated with myelin

=== Key Facts

* ~1,000 billion neurons
* Each connects to thousands of others
* Types:
** Sensory neurons
** Motor neurons
** Interneurons

=== All-or-Nothing Firing

* Neurons fire or they don’t — no halfway.
* Intensity encoded by:
** Number of neurons firing
** Firing frequency

== 7. How Neurons Communicate

* Neurons do *not* touch.
* Communication occurs across a tiny gap: the *synapse*.
* Neurotransmitters cross the gap and influence the next neuron.

== 8. Psychopharmacology: Drugs & Neurotransmitters

=== Types of Drugs

* *Agonists:* Increase neurotransmitter effects
** Produce more
** Prevent cleanup
** Mimic neurotransmitters
* *Antagonists:* Decrease neurotransmitter effects
** Destroy neurotransmitters
** Block receptor sites

=== Examples

* *Curare:* Antagonist → paralysis, death
* *Alcohol:* Inhibitory → disinhibits frontal lobe
* *Amphetamines:* Increase norepinephrine → arousal
* *Prozac:* Increases serotonin availability
* *L-DOPA:* Increases dopamine → helps Parkinson’s symptoms

== 9. Brain Architecture: Not Like a Computer

=== Why the Brain Differs

1. **Damage Resistance:** Brain can reroute functions.
2. **Speed Despite Slow Tissue:**
* Computers: serial, fast wires
* Brain: massive parallel processing

=== Neural Networks

Engineers attempt machine models of the brain, but current systems are far less capable than even a two-year-old human.

== 10. Brain Functions Not Needing the Brain

Certain reflexes operate without cortical involvement:

* Newborn sucking
* Withdrawal from pain
* Vomiting
* Sexual reflexes

== 11. Subcortical Structures

* *Medulla:* Heart rate, breathing
* *Cerebellum:* Balance, coordination
* *Hypothalamus:* Feeding, hunger, thirst, some sleep regulation

== 12. The Cortex

* Wrinkled outer layer; flattened = ~2 ft²
* Evolutionary expansion:
** Fish → none
** Reptiles → little
** Primates → a lot
** Humans → huge (80% of brain)

=== Four Lobes

* Frontal
* Parietal
* Occipital
* Temporal

Left & right duplication.

== 13. Topological Maps

=== Discovery

Electrical stimulation of cortex produced movements, sensations, colors, sounds.

=== Two Maps

* *Motor Cortex:* Movement
* *Somatosensory Cortex:* Sensation

=== Features

1. Topographical
2. Size reflects control/precision, not body size
3. Only a fraction of cortex — rest supports higher reasoning

== 14. Methods for Studying the Brain

=== Imaging

* CAT, PET, fMRI
* Show active areas during tasks

=== Lesion Studies

Damaged regions reveal function:

* *Apraxia:* Can move but not coordinate
* *Agnosia:* “Psychic blindness”
* *Sensory Neglect:* Ignore half of world
* *Aphasias:* Language impairments
* *Acquired Psychopathy:* Damage to frontal lobes

== 15. The Two Hemispheres

=== Lateralization

*Right-handed people (~90%):*
Left hemisphere = language

*Right hemisphere:* math, music

=== Crossover

* Visual fields cross to opposite hemispheres
* Motor control crosses as well

=== Corpus Callosum

Massive fiber bundle linking hemispheres.
Split-brain cases reveal hidden specialization.

== 16. The Hard Problem of Consciousness

=== Info-Processing Approach

Mind treated like a computer program.
Explains many cognitive functions.

=== What Remains

*Subjective experience (“what it feels like”)* is unexplained.

Classic framing:
How does physical tissue produce experience?

== 17. Mechanistic Conception: Ethical Implications

Mechanistic view: All mental life emerges from physical processes.

=== Conflicts With Humanist Values

1. *Free Will:* If everything is mechanistic, where is choice?
2. *Intrinsic Value:* How do machines have moral worth?
3. *Spiritual Value:* Mechanistic models leave no room for soul.

=== Possible Responses

1. Reject scientific view → embrace dualism
2. Reject humanist values → all illusions
3. Reconcile both → integrate science + meaning

== Key Takeaways

* Dualism vs. Materialism remains central debate
* Science strongly supports mind = brain activity
* Brain structure/function deeply map mental processes
* Consciousness remains mysterious
* Mechanistic view challenges free will and morality
