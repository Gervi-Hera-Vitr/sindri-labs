= Psychology Lecture Notes: The Unconscious and Behaviorism

== Part 1: The Unconscious – Evolutionary Perspective

=== Why Would an Unconscious Evolve?

==== Core Question Reframing
* Traditional question: *“Why are some things unconscious?”*
* Better question: *“Why is only a tiny subset of mental life conscious?”*
* Reality: Most mental activity is unconscious.

=== Deception Hypothesis

==== Basic Premise
* Evolution favored unconscious processes.
* The best lies are those we believe ourselves.
* You are a more effective liar if you believe your own deception.

==== Deception in Nature
* *Chimpanzees:* Hair stands on end → appear larger.
* *Angler fish:* Lure mimics prey → fools other fish.

==== Human Deception
* Humans excel at psychological deception.
* Constant self-presentation: tougher, smarter, sexier, more trustworthy.
* Social psychology studies strategies for managing impressions.

==== Lie Detection Arms Race
* Co-evolution of deceptive abilities and lie-detection mechanisms.

==== Hitchcock Anecdote
* Child actor couldn’t cry on command.
* Hitchcock told him: *“Your parents have left you and are never coming back.”*
* Genuine emotion → better acting.
* Principle: Authentic emotions outperform performed ones.

==== Applications to Pain & Emotion
* Pain contest → best strategy is to *actually be in pain*.
* Love → persuasion works better if you *truly believe it*.

==== Unconscious as Deception Shield
* Dark motives stay hidden.
* If you don’t consciously know your motives, you can’t reveal them involuntarily.

== Part 2: Behaviorism – Historical Context

=== Origins and Development
* Psychoanalysis: Created by Freud.
* Behaviorism: Pre-Skinner; early leader = Watson.
* Skinner: Packaged, expanded, and popularized behaviorism.

=== Skinner’s Cultural Impact
* 1960s–1970s: Talk shows, bestselling books, mainstream influence.

---

== Part 3: Core Principles of Behaviorism

=== Principle 1: Extreme Learning Emphasis
* Everything you know/are = learned.
* No innate human nature.
* Humans are infinitely malleable.

==== Watson’s Famous Boast
____
“Give me a dozen healthy infants … I’ll train them to become any type of specialist I choose.”
____

==== Egalitarian Implications
* No group is inherently superior.
* Differences arise from learning, not biology.

=== Principle 2: Anti-Mentalism
* Mental states (desires, wishes, goals) considered unscientific.
* Replace them with observable constructs:
** Stimulus
** Response
** Reinforcement
** Punishment
** Environment

=== Principle 3: No Significant Species Differences
* All animals learn via same mechanisms.
* Therefore: Nonhuman animals can model human learning.

---

== Part 4: Three Learning Mechanisms

== Mechanism 1: Habituation
* Decrease in response after repeated exposure to stimulus.
* Adaptive: Frees attention for novel events.

=== Key Properties
* Harmful stimuli remain noticed.
* Benign, repeated stimuli fade from awareness.

=== Research Use
* Studying infants and nonverbal animals.

---

== Mechanism 2: Classical Conditioning

=== Definition
* Learning association between two stimuli.

=== Pavlov’s Discovery
* Food (UCS) → salivation (UCR)
* Bell (neutral) + food → salivation
* Bell becomes CS → salivation becomes CR

=== Terms
* *UCS:* Unconditioned Stimulus
* *UCR:* Unconditioned Response
* *CS:* Conditioned Stimulus
* *CR:* Conditioned Response

=== Extinction & Spontaneous Recovery
* Repeated CS without UCS → CR weakens.
* After delay, CR returns when CS is reintroduced.

---

=== Classical Conditioning Applications

==== Case Study: Little Albert
* UCS: Loud noise
* UCR: Fear
* CS: Rat
* CR: Fear
* Generalization to related furry objects.

==== Phobia Development
* Neutral stimulus + trauma → phobia.

==== Systematic Desensitization
* Pair feared stimulus with relaxation.

==== Hunger & Addiction
* Eating/drinking/smoking become tied to environmental cues.

==== Fetish Development (Speculative)
* Accidental pairing of sexual arousal with unrelated objects.

---

=== Modern View: Preparation Theory
* Classical conditioning prepares organism for upcoming events.
* CS must precede UCS for strongest learning.
* CR ≠ UCR (CR is preparatory; UCR is direct).

==== Example: Child Abuse
* Raised hand (CS) → flinch (CR)
* Hit (UCS) → pain (UCR)

---

=== Pop Culture: *A Clockwork Orange*
* UCS: Drug-induced nausea
* CS: Violent imagery
* CR: Nausea at violence

---

== Mechanism 3: Operant Conditioning

=== Definition
* Learning relationship between action and consequence.

=== Differences from Classical Conditioning
* Classical = passive
* Operant = active

---

=== Thorndike’s Puzzle Box
* Cats escape by chance.
* Rewarded behaviors increase.
* Non-rewarded behaviors extinguish.

=== Law of Effect
* Reward → increased behavior
* No reward → decreased behavior

---

=== Reinforcement Types

==== Positive Reinforcement
* Add something desirable.

==== Negative Reinforcement
* Remove something aversive.
* NOT punishment.

==== Punishment
* Decreases likelihood of behavior.

---

=== Shaping: Training Complex Behavior
* Reinforce successive approximations.
* Build behavior step-by-step.

---

=== Primary vs. Secondary Reinforcers
* Primary: food, water, sex, pain avoidance.
* Secondary: learned via association (e.g., praise, tokens).

=== Token Economies
* Tokens exchanged for primary reinforcers.
* Allows complex reward schedules.

---

=== Schedules of Reinforcement

==== Ratio vs. Interval
* *Ratio:* Based on number of responses.
* *Interval:* Based on time.

==== Fixed vs. Variable
* *Fixed:* Predictable.
* *Variable:* Unpredictable.

==== Four Schedules
* FR (Fixed Ratio)
* VR (Variable Ratio)
* FI (Fixed Interval)
* VI (Variable Interval)

==== Slot Machine Example: VR Schedule
* Most addictive reinforcement schedule.

---

=== Partial Reinforcement Effect
* Intermittently rewarded behaviors resist extinction.
* Example: child nagging → parent gives in occasionally.

---

=== Skinner’s Extension to Human Society
* Proposed behaviorist engineering for:
** Justice system
** Parenting
** Social design
* Viewed free will as unnecessary concept.

---

== Part 5: Criticisms and Limitations of Behaviorism

=== 1. No Innate Knowledge
* Language acquisition shows innate structures.
* Early object understanding present in infants.
* Sexual preferences emerge without training.

=== 2. Unobservables Are Scientific
* Physics, chemistry, biology all study unobservable constructs.
* Internal mental mechanisms required for explanation.

=== 3. Learning Without Reinforcement
* Tolman’s rats formed mental maps without reward.
* Demonstrates latent learning.

=== 4. Species-Specific Learning Constraints
* Certain behaviors easier to learn depending on species and instinct.

=== Garcia Effect
* Taste + nausea → strong learning
* Taste + shock → no learning
* Prepared learning is biologically specific.

=== Prepared Phobias
* Humans and chimps predisposed to fear snakes, spiders, heights.
* Rare phobias for modern dangers (cars, outlets).

=== 5. Chomsky’s Critique
* Behaviorist terms become vague in human application.
* Risk of untestable circular explanations.
* Helped end behaviorism’s dominance.

---

== Part 6: Behaviorism’s Lasting Contributions

=== 1. Learning Mechanisms
* Habituation, classical conditioning, operant conditioning remain valid.

=== 2. Practical Training Techniques
* Effective for animals, infants, autistic individuals, clinical settings.

=== 3. Institutional Applications
* Token economies in prisons, hospitals, etc.

=== What Survived
* Empirical methods
* Learning principles
* Reinforcement-based training

=== What Failed
* Blank-slate theory
* Anti-mentalism
* Universal learning mechanisms
* Complete reduction to stimulus-response
