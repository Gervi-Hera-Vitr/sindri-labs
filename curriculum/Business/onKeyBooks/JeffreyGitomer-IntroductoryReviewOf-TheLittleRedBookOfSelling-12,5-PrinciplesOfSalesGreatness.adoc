This is my minimalistic review of the introduction to the little red book of selling.

== Lessons

Be Liked::
The very first lesson we learn is that if *_a customer likes you_*,
they believe in you, trust you, +
and *then* +
they *_MIGHT_* buy from you.

More importantly, people DON'T like to be sold to, *_but they love to buy_*!

Why do people buy?::
Between learning _"how to sell,"_ and,
*_why do people buy_*: +
*_Learning why people buy is 10000x more important!_*

Many think they know why customers buy, but in reality they don't.
This is proven when the seller observes:

. Receiving price objections;
. Have to send bids or proposals;
. A customer claims to be "satisfied with the present supplier";
. No one is returning their calls;
. Customers complain the economy is slow.

== Here is the truth:

Trust::
People buy because they LIKE their sales rep.
They like them and from that they have TRUST.

. They understand *_WHAT_* they are buying.
. They see (operating on) the *_difference_* between the *person* and the _company_ there buying from.
. They know the *_value_* of the product there purchasing.
. They have *_faith in_* (the expectation of) their sales representative.
. They have confidence in their sales representative.
. They have comfort with their sales representative.
. They *_feel_* their needs are satisfied by the product or service.
. The price *_seems_* fair (will not verify, needs to feel instead).
. The product or service will increase their productivity - perceived cost reduction.
. The product or service will increase their profit - perceived revenue increase or cost reduction.
. IMPORTANT: They feel that -- the salesperson is trying to help them build their business to earn the sale. Such a salesperson feels valuable to them.

== Understand your customer:

The best way to understand your customers::
. Call the best of them;
. Invite them to a seminar on how to build THEIR business;
. Offer great luxury and food;
. Tell them there will also be 15‚Äì20 minutes worth of questions on how to improve.

* Strengthen their relationship;
* Craft some questions about how you meet their needs;
* Ask them for what they are looking for in a vendor/partner;

*_Record the session to study over and over._*

== Final Grade

This assignment is NOT graded -- the book is over the kid's head.
We will revisit next year.
