This is a book by Robert Kiyosaki that I wanted to study for some time now.

== Seven (7) Key Lessons in the Book:

The entire book is structured around seven key lessons boys learn about money and life.

=== The Rich Don‚Äôt Work for Money

Meaning::
Instead of working for money (trading time for a paycheck), the rich build or acquire assets that generate passive income.

What Happens in the Book::
Robert and Mike work for Rich Dad for free.
They learn that working hard on a job doesn‚Äôt make you wealthy;
*_it keeps you dependent_*.

Real-Life Applications::
* Create passive income streams through rental properties, dividends, or royalties.
* Invest in businesses or assets that continue earning money without your daily involvement.

Example::
Buying vending machines, placing them in high-traffic areas, and collecting profits.

=== Financial Literacy is Key

Meaning::
You must understand how money works‚Äîknow the difference between assets and liabilities.

What Happens in the Book::
Rich Dad teaches Robert and Mike that #assets# *_put money in_* your pocket,
while #liabilities# *_take money out_*.
Many people confuse the two.

Real-Life Applications::
* *Buy income-generating assets*: stocks, bonds, rental properties.
* Track your income, expenses, assets, and liabilities _using a simple balance sheet_.

Example::
Purchasing dividend-paying stocks that send you regular income,
instead of buying a brand-new car
-- a car is always a liability.

=== Mind Your Own Business

Meaning::
Focus on building your own assets, even if you have a job.

What Happens in the Book::
Robert keeps his day job but builds his asset column on the side.
Ray Kroc (McDonald‚Äôs) wasn‚Äôt in the burger business: he was in the real estate business.

Real-Life Applications::
* Start a side business or build a portfolio of investments.
* Build intellectual property, i.e., write a book, create digital products.

Example::
Creating an online course on a skill you know and selling it on platforms like uDemy.

=== The Power of Corporations & Tax Laws

Meaning::
The rich use corporations to _protect and grow their wealth_, gaining tax advantages.

What Happens in the Book::
Rich Dad teaches how corporations pay expenses before taxes,
while employees pay taxes before expenses.

Real-Life Applications::
* Start an LLC or corporation to legally deduct business expenses, i.e., home office, car, travel.
* Understand how to use tax laws to your advantage.

Example::
Running an online business through an LLC and deducting expenses like internet, phone, and education.

=== The Rich Invent Money

Meaning::
With financial intelligence, you can create opportunities to build wealth that others can‚Äôt see.

What Happens in the Book::
Robert and Mike open a comic book library and earn money without working there.

Real-Life Applications::
* Spot undervalued assets such as real estate, stocks -- buy low, sell high.
* Create products or services based on market demand.

Example::
Flipping furniture by buying inexpensive pieces, restoring them, and selling at a profit.

=== Work to Learn, Not to Earn

Meaning::
Focus on acquiring skills that will help you build wealth rather than just working for a paycheck.

What Happens in the Book::
Robert works different jobs to learn sales, marketing, and management.

Real-Life Applications::
* Take jobs that build sales, marketing, or leadership skills.
* Learn about investing, accounting, and business management.

Example::
Working part-time on a sales job to get comfortable closing deals,
then using those skills to sell your own product.

=== Overcoming Obstacles -- Important!

Meaning::
*_Fear, laziness, bad habits, cynicism, and arrogance prevent most people from achieving financial freedom._*

What Happens in the Book::
Rich Dad explains how fear keeps people stuck in the rat race, and how greed, bad habits, and cynicism trap them.

Real-Life Applications::
* Build the habit of investing a percentage of income monthly.
* Face the fear of investing by starting small and learning as you go.

Example::
Automating $50 a month into an index fund, even when it feels scary or unfamiliar.
