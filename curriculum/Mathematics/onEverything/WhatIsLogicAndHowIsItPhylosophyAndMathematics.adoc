== Mathematical Logic

=== What is Mathematical Logic?

Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring formal systems in relation to the way we reason. It provides tools to analyze the structure of arguments, statements, and proofs.

| Symbol | Name          | Operation Example | Meaning

| ¬¨      | Negation      | ¬¨P                | "not P"
| ‚àß      | Conjunction   | P ‚àß Q             | "P and Q"

== Propositional Logic

=== What is Propositional Calculus?

The propositional calculus is a branch of logic. It is also called propositional logic.

=== What is a Proposition?

Mathematical logic is also the study of truths in mathematical statements. These are called propositions ‚Äî a claim that is either true or false.

Example of a proposition: `2 + 2 = 4`
This can only be either true or false.

== Notational Variants of Connectives

These are some standard notations for propositional logic.

| Logical Operation | Name          | Common Notations                                  | Explanation

| AND               | Conjunction   | `A ‚àß B`, `A ¬∑ B`, `AB`, `A & B`, `A && B`         | True if *both* A and B are true.
| OR                | Disjunction   | `A ‚à® B`, `A + B`, `A ‚à£ B`, `A ‚à• B`                | True if *at least one* of A or B is true.
| NOT               | Negation      | `¬¨A`, `‚àíA`, `ƒÄ`, `~A`                             | True if A is false. Negates A.

| Symbol | Name                        | Meaning in Mathematics

| ‚àà      | Element of                  | Indicates that an element belongs to a set. Example: `3 ‚àà ‚Ñï`
| ‚Ñï      | Natural Numbers             | `{0, 1, 2, 3, ...}`
| ‚Ñ§      | Integers                    | `{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}`

| ‚äÇ      | Proper Subset               | A ‚äÇ B means all elements of A are in B, and A ‚â† B.
| ‚äÉ      | Proper Superset             | A ‚äÉ B means A contains all elements of B, and A ‚â† B.

== Theory of Proofs

Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. Proofs are treated as formal mathematical objects. They are constructed according to axioms and rules of inference and are syntactic in nature, contrasting with model theory (semantic).

== Deductive Reasoning

Deductive reasoning seeks certainty based on given information.
It involves drawing valid inferences, where a conclusion logically follows from premises.

*Argument:*
All birds have feathers.
A sparrow is a bird.
Therefore, a sparrow has feathers.

*Explanation:*
Starts with a universal truth and applies it to a specific case, yielding a certain conclusion.

== Inductive Reasoning

Inductive reasoning supports conclusions with some probability, not certainty.
Unlike deductive reasoning, its conclusions are probable based on evidence.

*Argument:*
I ate peanuts yesterday and had no allergic reaction.
I ate peanuts last week and felt fine.
I‚Äôve eaten peanuts many times with no issues.
Therefore, I am probably not allergic to peanuts.

*Explanation:*
General conclusion based on repeated experience. Likely but not guaranteed.

=== Types of Inductive Reasoning

*Inductive Generalization:*
Infers general rules from specific cases.
E.g., Observing that 3 out of 4 sampled balls are black ‚Üí urn likely has mostly black balls.

*Statistical Generalization:*
Uses sampling with margin of error.
E.g., 66% support Measure Z ‚Üí ~66% of voters might.

*Anecdotal Generalizations:*
Based on isolated/personal experience.
Prone to hasty generalization fallacy.

*Prediction:*
Forecasts a future event based on observed patterns.
E.g., Most apples picked were red ‚Üí next likely red.

*Statistical Syllogism:*
From general truth to individual claim.
E.g., 90% of grads go to college ‚Üí Bob probably does too.

*Argument from Analogy:*
If A and B are similar in X, they might also share Y.
E.g., Two minerals share traits ‚Üí one may share more.

*Causal Inference:*
Suggests probable causal relation from correlation.
Common in science and experimentation.

== Fallacies

A fallacy is faulty reasoning in an argument. It may appear valid if not examined carefully.

=== Use of Fallacies

Fallacies can be intentional (manipulation) or unintentional (bias, ignorance, language limits).
Context affects validity, especially in areas like legal reasoning.

=== Types of Fallacies

==== Formal Fallacies (Errors in Structure)

*Definition:*
A mistake in structure of deductive argument. Conclusion doesn‚Äôt follow from premises.

*Key Point:*
Affects deductive arguments.
Known as non sequitur.

*Example:*
Affirming the Consequent
If it rains, the ground gets wet.
The ground is wet.
Therefore, it rained.
(But maybe a sprinkler did it.)

==== Informal Fallacies (Errors in Content)

*Definition:*
Problem arises from content/context, not form.
Argument might be valid but unconvincing.

*Key Point:*
Affects both deductive and inductive reasoning.

*Examples:*

1. *Hasty Generalization*
Broad claim from limited sample.
E.g., ‚ÄúMy two neighbors are rude, so everyone in this city is rude.‚Äù

2. *Faulty Generalization*
Conclusion drawn with insufficient evidence.
Becomes valid with enough reliable data.

3. *Post Hoc Fallacy (False Cause)*
Assumes sequence = causation.
E.g., ‚ÄúI ate a mushroom and got sick, so the mushroom must be poisonous.‚Äù
