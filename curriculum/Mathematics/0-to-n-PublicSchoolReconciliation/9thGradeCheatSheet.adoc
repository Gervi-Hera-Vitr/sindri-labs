== Chapter 1: Exponents

=== Product Rule
Formula: X^a * X^b = X^(a+b) +
Explanation: If you have two numbers with the same base, multiplying them means keeping the base and adding the exponents. +
Example: 5^3 * 5^4 = 5^7

=== Quotient Rule
Formula: X^a / X^b = X^(a-b), as long as x ≠ 0 +
Explanation: Divide with same base → subtract exponents. +
Example: 7^5 / 7^2 = 7^3

=== Power of a Power Rule
Formula: (X^a)^b = X^(a*b) +
Explanation: Raise a power to another → multiply exponents. +
Example: (3^2)^4 = 3^8

=== Power of a Product Rule
Formula: (a * b)^x = a^x * b^x +
Explanation: Distribute the exponent to each factor. +
Example: (2 * 5)^3 = 2^3 * 5^3 = 1000

=== Power of a Quotient Rule
Formula: (a/b)^x = a^x / b^x, b ≠ 0 +
Explanation: Apply exponent to both numerator and denominator. +
Example: (4/3)^2 = 16/9

=== Zero Exponent Rule
Formula: X^0 = 1, x ≠ 0 +
Explanation: Any nonzero base raised to 0 = 1. +
Example: 10000^0 = 1

=== Negative Exponent Rule
Formula: X^-a = 1 / X^a, x ≠ 0 +
Explanation: Flip base and make exponent positive. +
Example: 5^-3 = 1/125; 1/2^-4 = 2^4 = 16

=== Exponential Growth and Decay

*Growth:* A = P(1 + r)^t +
*Decay:* A = P(1 - r)^t +
Example: A = 1000(1.05)^3 = 1157.63

=== Scientific Notation

Used for very large or very small numbers. +
Examples: +
3,200,000 = 3.2 × 10^6 +
0.00042 = 4.2 × 10^-4

== Chapter 2: Polynomials

=== Types of Polynomials

* Monomial: 1 term (e.g., 2x)
* Binomial: 2 terms (e.g., 3x + 5)
* Trinomial: 3 terms (e.g., 4x^2 − 3x + 2)
* Polynomial: >3 terms (e.g., x^4 + 3x^3 − 2x^2 + 5x − 1)
* Degree: Highest exponent in the polynomial +
Example: 4x^3 + 2x^2 − x has degree 3

=== Operations with Polynomials

*Collecting Like Terms:* Same variables and exponents +
Example: 3x^2 + 5x^2 = 8x^2

*Distributive Property:* a(b + c) = ab + ac +
Example: 3(x + 4) = 3x + 12

=== Multiplying Polynomials

*Binomial × Binomial:* (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd +
Example: (x + 3)(x + 5) = x^2 + 8x + 15

*Binomial × Trinomial:* +
(x + 2)(x^2 + 3x + 4) = x^3 + 5x^2 + 10x + 8

=== Factoring Polynomials

*Common Factor:* +
6x^2 + 9x = 3x(2x + 3)

*Trinomial Factoring:* +
x^2 + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)

== Chapter 3: Solving Equations

=== Basic Equations
Example: x + 4 = 7 → x = 3

=== Two-Step Equations
Example: 3x - 5 = 10 → x = 5

=== Equations with Fractions
x / 3 = 5 → Multiply both sides by 3 → x = 15

=== Distributive Property in Equations
2(x − 3) = 10 → 2x − 6 = 10 → x = 8

=== Cross-Multiplication (Proportions)

If a/b = c/d, then ad = bc +
Example: x/5 = 3/10 → x = 1.5

=== Variables on Both Sides

Example: 5x + 3 = 2x + 9 → x = 2

== Chapter 4: Linear Relationships

=== Scatter Plots and Correlation

* Independent Variable → x-axis
* Dependent Variable → y-axis
* Correlation Types: Positive, Negative, None
* Line of Best Fit: Represents data trend
* Interpolation vs. Extrapolation

=== Distance-Time Graphs

* Slope = speed
* Flat line = no movement
* Steep = faster
* Downward = return
* Curved = acceleration or deceleration

=== Slope and Equation of a Line

* Slope: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
* Forms:
- Slope-Intercept: y = mx + b
- Point-Slope: y - y1 = m(x - x1)
- Standard: Ax + By + C = 0
* Direct: y = mx (through origin)
* Partial: y = mx + b

=== Converting Representations

*Table → Equation:* Find slope, y-intercept → y = mx + b
*Graph → Equation:* Use slope and y-intercept → y = mx + b
*Equation → Graph:* Plot y-intercept, use slope for points

=== Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

* Parallel: Same slope
* Perpendicular: Negative reciprocals
* Horizontal: y = c (slope = 0)
* Vertical: x = c (slope undefined)

== Chapter 5: Geometry

=== Angles and Triangles

* Complementary: 90°
* Supplementary: 180°
* Parallel Line Pairs: Corresponding, Alternate Interior, Alternate Exterior

=== Triangle Properties

* Interior Angles Sum: 180°
* Exterior Angle = sum of opposite interior angles
* Isosceles Theorem: Equal sides → equal angles

=== Right Triangle Properties

*Pythagorean Theorem:* a^2 + b^2 = c^2
*Trigonometry:* SOH CAH TOA
*Angles of Elevation/Depression*

=== Perimeter, Area, and Volume

* Rectangle: P = 2l + 2w, A = lw
* Triangle: A = 1/2bh
* Circle: C = 2πr, A = πr^2
* Sphere: V = 4/3πr^3
* Cylinder: V = πr^2h

=== Transformations

* Translation: Slide
* Reflection: Flip
* Rotation: Turn
* Dilation: Resize

== Chapter 6: Probability and Statistics

=== Basic Probability

* Formula: P = favorable / total
* Independent: One doesn't affect the other
* Dependent: One affects the other

=== Descriptive Statistics

* Mean = average
* Median = middle value
* Mode = most frequent
* Range = highest − lowest

=== Data Representation

* Bar Graphs
* Histograms
* Pie Charts
* Box Plots
