== 1. Solving a Linear System (Graphing / Substitution / Elimination)

=== ➤ Concept
A linear system consists of two equations. The solution is where both equations are true simultaneously, often represented as the *point of intersection*.
There are three main methods:

* *Graphing* – Plot each equation on the Cartesian plane and identify the intersection point.
* *Substitution* – Solve one equation for one variable, substitute it into the other, and solve.
* *Elimination* – Add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable, then solve for the other.

=== ➤ Example
Solve the system:
[source,txt]
----
x - y = 5
3x + y = 3
----

==== Graphing Method:
 Convert both equations to slope-intercept form:
[source,txt]
----
x - y = 5  ➜  y = x - 5
3x + y = 3  ➜  y = -3x + 3
----
 Plot both lines on the graph.
 They intersect at the point `(2, -3)`.

==== Substitution Method:
1. From the first equation:
`x - y = 5` ➜ isolate `y`:
[source,txt]
----
y = x - 5
----
. Substitute into the second equation:
[source,txt]
----
3x + (x - 5) = 3
4x - 5 = 3
4x = 8
x = 2
----
. Substitute `x = 2` into `y = x - 5`:
[source,txt]
----
y = 2 - 5 = -3
----

==== Elimination Method:
1. Align equations:
[source,txt]
----
x - y = 5
3x + y = 3
----
 Add the equations to eliminate `y`:
[source,txt]
----
(x - y) + (3x + y) = 5 + 3
4x = 8
x = 2
----
 Substitute `x = 2` into the first equation:
[source,txt]
----
2 - y = 5
y = 2 - 5 = -3
----

✅ *Solution*: `(2, -3)`

=== ➤ Practice Question:
Solve the system:
[source,txt]
----
2x + 3y = 12
4x - y = 5
----

== 2. Elimination (Advanced)

=== ➤ Concept
When coefficients do not align for direct elimination, multiply one or both equations to create coefficients with equal absolute values. Then, add or subtract to eliminate one variable.

=== ➤ Example
Solve the system:
[source,txt]
----
4x + 3y = 10
5x - 4y = -2
----

=== ➤ Steps:
1. Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second by 4 to align `x` coefficients:
[source,txt]
----
5(4x + 3y) = 50x + 15y = 50
4(5x - 4y) = 20x - 16y = -8
----
 Subtract the second equation from the first:
[source,txt]
----
(50x + 15y) - (20x - 16y) = 50 - (-8)
30x + 31y = 58
----

(This example has an inconsistency—corrected approach below)

==== Correct Steps:
1. Multiply the first equation by five and second equations by 4:
[source,txt]
----
4x + 3y = 10 ➜ 5(4x + 3y) = 20x + 15y = 50
5x - 4y = -2 ➜ 4(5x - 4y) = 20x - 16y = -8
----
 Subtract:
[source,txt]
----
(20x + 15y) - (20x - 16y) = 50 - (-8)
(20x + 15y) - 20x + 16y = 50 + 8
31y = 58
y = 58 / 31
y = 2
----
 Substitute `y = 2` into the first equation:
[source,txt]
----
4x + 3(2) = 10
4x + 6 = 10
4x = 4
x = 1
----

✅ *Solution*: `(1, 2)`

=== ➤ Practice Question:
Solve the system:
[source,txt]
----
3x - 2y = 14
5x + 3y = 1
----

== 3. Solving Linear Systems in Applications

=== ➤ Concept
Translate real-life situations into linear equations and solve using substitution or elimination. Define variables clearly based on the problem.

=== ➤ Example
*A sports shop sells Adidas shoes for $82 and Air Jensen shoes for $95. They sold 75 pairs in total and made $6241. How many of each did they sell?*

=== ➤ Steps:
1. Define variables:
`x` = number of Adidas shoes
`y` = number of Air Jensen shoes

2. Create equations:
[source,txt]
----
x + y = 75
82x + 95y = 6241
----

 Multiply the first equation by 82:
[source,txt]
----
82(x + y) = 82(75)
82x + 82y = 6150
----

 Subtract the two equations:
[source,txt]
----
(82x + 95y) - (82x + 82y) = 6241 - 6150
95y - 82y = 91
13y = 91
y = 7
----

 Substitute `y = 7` into `x + y = 75`:
[source,txt]
----
x = 75 - 7
x = 68
----

✅ *Solution*: `68 Adidas`, `7 Air Jensen`

=== ➤ Practice Question:
*A concert sold 120 tickets for $10 and $15. Total sales were $1500. How many tickets of each were sold?*

*Hint*:
1. Let `x` = $10 tickets
Let `y` = $15 tickets
2. Equations:
[source,txt]
----
x + y = 120
10x + 15y = 1500

t = 5 or t = -1
----
✅ *Time*: `t = 5` seconds (reject `t = -1` as time can't be negative)

==== (b) What is the maximum height?
Vertex occurs at `t = -b / (2a)`
[source,txt]
----
t = -64 / (2 * -16) = 2 seconds
h(2) = -16(2)² + 64(2) + 80
h(2) = -64 + 128 + 80 = 144
----
✅ *Maximum height*: `144 ft`

==== (c) When is the object 100 ft high?
Set `h(t) = 100`:
[source,txt]
----
-16t² + 64t + 80 = 100
-16t² + 64t - 20 = 0
Divide by -4:
4t² - 16t + 5 = 0
Quadratic formula:
t = [16 ± √((-16)² - 4(4)(5))] / (2 * 4)
t = [16 ± √(256 - 80)] / 8
t = [16 ± √176] / 8
t = [16 ± 4√11] / 8
t = 2 ± (√11)/2
----
Approximate values:
✅ *Time*: `0.34 s` on the way up, `3.66 s` on the way down

== 22. Trigonometry (SOHCAHTOA, Sine's Law, Cosine Law)

=== ➤ Concept

==== ➤ Right-Angle Trigonometry (SOHCAHTOA)
[source,txt]
----
sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse
cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse
tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent
----

=== ➤ Example (Right Triangle)
Given: `θ = 30°`, hypotenuse = 30, find opposite side `x`.
[source,txt]
----
sin(30°) = x / 30
0.5 = x / 30
x = 15
----

==== ➤ Sine's Law (Non-Right Triangles)
[source,txt]
----
a / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)
----

=== ➤ Example (Sine Law)
Given: `A = 40°`, `a = 8`, `B = 60°`
Find `b`:
[source,txt]
----
b / sin(60°) = 8 / sin(40°)
b = (sin(60°) * 8) / sin(40°)
b ≈ (0.866 * 8) / 0.643
b ≈ 10.78
----

==== ➤ Cosine Law (Non-Right Triangles)
[source,txt]
----
c² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)
----

=== ➤ Example (Cosine Law - Finding a Side)
Given: `a = 7`, `b = 10`, `C = 120°`
[source,txt]
----
c² = 7² + 10² - 2(7)(10)cos(120°)
c² = 49 + 100 - 2(7)(10)(-0.5)
c² = 149 + 70
c² = 219
c = √219 ≈ 14.8
----

=== ➤ Practice Questions
1. Solve `ΔABC`:
* `A = 35°`, `a = 7`, `B = 65°`
Find `b` and `C`.
2. Find the missing side in a right triangle with `θ = 45°`, hypotenuse = 10.
3. Use cosine law to find angle `C` in `ΔABC` with `a = 8`, `b = 6`, `c = 10`.
