TIP: This course is meant to teach you algebra by solving problems. The topic not here is matrices as that will be done in my Linear Algebra course.

== Basic Algebra

=== What is a Variable?

A _variable_ is a letter that represents an unknown number.
Example: `x`, `y`, `z`

=== Expressions

- A *mathematical expression* is a combination of terms like `3x`, `3x + 5`, or `3x + 5 + 2y`.
- A *monomial* is a single term (e.g. `3x`)
- A *binomial* has two terms (e.g. `3x + 5`)
- A *trinomial* has three terms (e.g. `3x + 5 + 2y`)
- A *polynomial* has two or more terms and may include different math operations.

=== Equations and Inequalities

- An *equation* includes an equals sign, e.g. `7x = 14`
- An *inequality* uses symbols like `<`, `>`, `‚â§`, `‚â•`, or `‚â†`

=== Like Terms

- *Like terms* have the same variable (e.g. `3x` and `7x`)
- *Unlike terms* have different variables (e.g. `3x` and `4y`)
- You can add or subtract like terms, but not unlike terms.

=== Coefficient and Variable

In `7a`, `7` is the *coefficient* and `a` is the *variable*.

=== Operations on Terms

- `3x + 7x = 10x` (addition of like terms)
- `3x + 4y` ‚Üí cannot be simplified (unlike terms)
- `3 * x = 3x`
- `3x * 2y = 6xy` (multiplying terms with different variables)
- `3x / 4x = 3/4` because `x / x = 1`

== Properties of Numbers

In algebra, several fundamental properties help us understand how numbers behave during addition and multiplication. Here are the key properties:

1. *Commutative Property of Addition*::
No matter the order in which you add two numbers, the sum remains the same.
+
Example:
+
----
a + b = b + a
----

2. *Commutative Property of Multiplication*::
The order of multiplying two numbers does not affect the result.
+
Example:
+
----
a ¬∑ b = b ¬∑ a
----

3. *Associative Property of Addition*::
When adding a group of numbers, you can regroup them in any way without changing the sum.
+
Example:
+
----
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
----

4. *Associative Property of Multiplication*::
When multiplying a group of numbers, the way you group them does not change the product.
+
Example:
+
----
(a ¬∑ b) ¬∑ c = a ¬∑ (b ¬∑ c)
----

5. *Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition*::
Multiplying a number by a group of numbers added together is the same as multiplying each addend individually and then adding the results.
+
Example:
+
----
a ¬∑ (b + c) = a ¬∑ b + a ¬∑ c
----

== Solving Basic Equations
1. Simplify each side of the equation
2. Add and/or subtract like terms
3. Multiply or divide unlike terms
+
----
Example:
4x + 2x - 7 + 9 + x = 5x - x
7x + 2 = 4x
3x = -2
x = -2/3
----

== Solving Inequalities
Inequalities have symbols such as: +
> greater than +
< lesser than +
‚â§ Less than or equal too +
‚â• greater than or equal too +

How to solve:
1. Simplify each side of the equation
2. Add and/or subtract like terms
3. Multiply or divide unlike terms
4. If you multiply or divide by a negative flip the inequality.
