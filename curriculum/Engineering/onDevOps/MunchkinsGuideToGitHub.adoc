*_This is a comprehensive yet TL;DR guide to {git-docs}[Git] and {github-docs}[GitHub] by Captain Lugaru._*

== What are `git` and GitHub?

=== What is Git?

Git is a _**distributed** version (*revision*) control **system** (VCS)_ designed to track changes in files, usually code.
It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project while maintaining a detailed history of all changes.
Key features of git:

- *Version Control*: Tracks every change in a project, allowing you to revert to earlier versions.
- *Branching* and *Merging*: Create separate branches for different tasks, (e.g., new features, bug fixes,) and merge them back into the main branch.
- *_Distributed System_*: _Every developer has a *complete copy* of the project, including the history._
- *Efficiency*: Git handles large projects efficiently and is widely used in software development.

==== Why Use Git?

It:

. Prevents code conflicts by allowing developers to work on separate branches.
. Enables collaboration across teams, even remotely.
. Keeps a history of all changes, making it easier to debug or audit the code.
. Provides a simple way to revert to previous versions of code; cherrypick, stash, squash, rebase, etc.
. ... is so cool!

==== Common Use Cases:

- Software development.
- Writing technical documentation.
- Managing infrastructure as code.


=== Now, What is GitHub?

GitHub is a _platform_ built on top of Git that provides _hosting_ for repositories,
collaboration tools, and additional features to manage software development projects.

==== Key Features of GitHub:

- *Repository Hosting*: Store and manage Git repositories in the cloud; to have a shared central copy as a system of record (SoR).
- *Collaboration*: Tools for _code reviews_, _discussions_, wikis, blogs, and managing _issues_.
- *Community*: A hub for open-source, shared-source, and private group projects; and networking with contributors of all types.
- *Automation*: Automate tasks with {github-actions-docs}[GitHub Actions] (e.g., testing, deployment).
- *Documentation*: Built-in support for {github-wikis}[wikis] and scene-civilized repository {kai-root-files}[root layout files] (example by {kai-author}),
such as the {github-readmes}[active README] files; and even automatic blogging with {github-pages}[GitHub Pages].

==== Why use GitHub?

- *Portfolio*: Showcase your work and contributions.
- *Collaboration*: Work with other developers remotely.
- *Learning*: Contribute to open-source projects and learn from others’ code.


==== Key Benefits for Teams:

- Centralized codebase for all team members.
- Tools for tracking tasks, issues, and progress.
- Automated workflows to streamline testing and deployment.

=== Git vs GitHub:

Git is a revision control system that runs locally on your computer;
or remotely on a server; or as a backing service -- present in every Git repository.
It requires a manual setup for collaboration.
Git is open source software freely available to use and modify, but not as a service.

GitHub is a hosting platform built on top of Git.
It uses Git as a backing service for version control.
It is accessible through the internet and provides collaboration tools.
It is a proprietary platform with free and paid tiers.


== Key Terminology:

- *Repository (Repo)*: A folder that stores your project’s files and history; physically a `.git/` folder.
- *Working Copy*: A reduced projection of all commits on all files in the repository; usually a sibling to the hidden `.git/` folder.
- *Commit*: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.
- *Branch*: A separate version of the repository for independent work.
- *Merge*: Integrating changes from one branch into another.
- *Pull Request (PR)*: A request to merge changes from one branch to another, often used for code reviews.
- *Fork*: A personal copy of another person’s repository.
- *Clone*: A local copy of a repository.
- *Issue*: A way to track bugs, feature requests, or tasks.
- *Remote*: The cloud-based version of your repository (hosted on GitHub); or another teammate repository in their `.git` folder.
- *HEAD*: The pointer to the current commit in your working directory.


== Setting up Git and GitHub:

=== Local Git instance:

In the simplest way::
- Download Git for your operating system from Git-SCM.
- Install Git following the setup instructions for your OS.

More common way::
- Install git using a package manager, such as Homebrew or Apt.
- Configure a local user Git instance for one or more SoRs.

Next, Configure git::
[source,shell]
----
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
----

Verify Configuration::
[source,shell]
----
git config --list
----

Optional Git Configurations::

Set the default editor:
[source,shell]
----
git config --global core.editor "vim"
----


=== Create a GitHub Account:

Sign up at GitHub by going to https://github.com.
Verify your email address to complete registration.


==== Step 1: Setting up your first Repository.

- Log in to your GitHub account.
- Click Repositories > New.
- Fill in the repository name and description.
- Choose Public or Private visibility.
- Initialize with a README (optional).

==== Step 2: Clone the repository to your `local` machine and `push` a change:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`

Add and commit a change::
- `cd your-repo-name`
- Create or Modify Files
- Stage changes: `git add .`
- commit the changes: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
- push changes to GitHub: `git push`

Observe your change on the GitHub repository welcome page.
I recommend changing the contents of the README or README.md file.
Also, my preferred markup is AsciiDoc, i.e., README.adoc; now fully supported.

==== Step 3: Connect GitHub and Git

Option A: HTTPS (simplest for beginners)::
* No setup, but you'll need to enter your username/password or use a personal access token

Option B: SSH (preferred for regular use)::

Generate an SSH key:

[source,shell]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
----

Add your SSH key to GitHub (Account Settings > SSH and GPG keys)

Test SSH connection:
[source,shell]
----
ssh -T git@github.com
----

GitHub Desktop, CLI, and API (Optional Tools)::

. GitHub Desktop
* A Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Git/GitHub
* Available at https://desktop.github.com/

. GitHub CLI
* A command-line interface to interact with GitHub (repos, issues, PRs)
* Install: https://cli.github.com/
* Authenticate: `gh auth login`

. GitHub REST API / GraphQL API
* For advanced users and integrations


=== The GitHub Interface

Overview of GitHub Dashboard::
- *Repositories*: View and manage all your repositories.
- *Pull Requests*: Monitor and manage PRs for collaboration.
- *Issues*: Track and manage bugs or feature requests.
- *Explore*: Discover trending projects or topics.
- *Settings*: Configure profile, repositories, and account settings.

Understanding the Repository Page::
- *Code*: View and manage files in the repository.
- *Issues*: Log and manage issues for the project.
- *Pull Requests*: Collaborate on changes.
- *Actions*: Set up and view automated workflows.
- *Insights*: Analyze repository activity and contributions.

_I recommend finding all of these elements by yourself -- it is fun._

=== GitHub CLI (`gh`) -- _A preferred Way!_

Install GitHub CLI::
* macOS: `brew install gh`
* Linux: Use package managers, e.g., `apt install gh`

NOTE: See `fluent local setup` for a complete guide.

.Authenticate
[source,shell]
----
gh auth login
----

.Clone a repository:
[source,shell]
----
gh repo clone owner/repo-name
----

.Create a Repository:
[source,shell]
----
gh repo create my-repo --public --clone
----

Options:

* `--private`: For a private repository
* `--source=.`: Create from a local folder
.Create a Pull Request:
[source,shell]
----
gh pr create --base main --head feature-branch --title "Add new feature"
----


== Core Git Commands & Usage

`git init` -- Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory:

* Creates a `.git/` folder to track changes.
* Turns your folder into a Git repository.

.Clone a Repository
[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
----

.Show status
[source,shell]
----
git status
----

.Stage changes
[source,shell]
----
git add file.txt        # Stage one file
git add .               # Stage all changed files
----

.Commit changes
[source,shell]
----
git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"
----

.Push changes
[source,shell]
----
git push origin main
----

.Pull changes
[source,shell]
----
git pull origin main
----

.Fetch changes
[source,shell]
----
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
----

.Displays the commit history.
[source,shell]
----
git log                # Full history
git log --oneline      # Short version
----

.Show differences
[source,shell]
----
git diff                  # Working directory vs staging area
git diff --staged         # Staging area vs latest commit
----

.List, create, or delete branches.
[source,shell]
----
git branch                  # Lists all branches
git branch new-feature      # Creates a new branch
git branch -d new-feature   # Deletes a branch
----

.Switch to another branch.
[source,shell]
----
git checkout main
----

.Create and switch in one step:
[source,shell]
----
git checkout -b new-feature
----

.Merge changes from another branch into your current one.
[source,shell]
----
git merge new-feature
----

Resolving Merge Conflicts::
Conflicts happen if:
* Two branches changed the same line.
* Files were modified and deleted differently.

Git shows:
----
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your code
=======
Incoming code
>>>>>>> new-feature
----

.Resolve manually, then:
[source,shell]
----
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
----

Undoing Changes in Git::
A ubiquitous occurrence!

.Unstage a File
[source,shell]
----
git reset HEAD file.txt
----

.Discard Local Changes (Unstaged)
[source,shell]
----
git checkout -- file.txt
----

.Undo Last Commit (Soft Reset)
[source,shell]
----
git reset --soft HEAD~1
----
That keeps your changes in the working directory.

.Hard Reset (Danger!)
[source,shell]
----
git reset --hard HEAD~1
----
Deletes the last commit and discards changes.

Git Stashing -- Temporary Work Storage::
This is a crucial and frequently used capability.

What is Git Stash?::
Temporarily saves your changes when you need to:
* Switch branches
* Pull updates
* Work on something else

.Save Changes Away
[source,shell]
----
git stash
----

.View Stashes
[source,shell]
----
git stash list
----

.Apply the Last Stash
[source,shell]
----
git stash pop
----

Git Tags (Marking Important Commits)::
Tags are commonly used for releases.
Most importantly, tags are a local and pairing organization tool.

.Tagging
[source,shell]
----
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
----

=== Rebasing

*_This practice is so important that it gets its own section!_*

What Is Rebase?::
Reapply commits from your branch onto a new base branch.

Why Rebase?::
* Simplifies history
* Keeps the entire branch history
* Rewrites commits onto the base branch for a linear history

This allows stitching a project together like Lego pieces from finished changes.
When mastered, it is a game-changer.

.Rebase Example
[source,shell]
----
git checkout feature
git rebase main
----

[CAUTION]
.Never push rebase!
====

Although useful in some edge cases, you should never `git push --force`.
Rebasing works best when rebasing to protected branches upstream.
Pushing a protected branch rebased to something else should never happen.

[source,shell]
----
git push --force
----

====

=== Git Configuration Tips

Having `git` configured properly is an absolute necessity to effective work environment.

Global Git Ignore File::
Avoid repeating `.gitignore` for all projects:
[source,shell]
----
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
----

NOTE: The `.gitignore` is location sensitive and stacks on top of the global one and parent folder
-- we can use this to our advantage.

Sign Commits with GPG (NECESSARY)::
Verifying commit authenticity, required on all community shared projects:

.User global enabled gpg
[source,shell]
----
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
----

== GitHub Example Workflow (in Real Life)

.Clone a Repo
[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo
----

.Create a Feature Branch
[source,shell]
----
git checkout -b feature-branch
----

.Make Changes & Stage Them
[source,shell]
----
git add file.txt
----

.Commit Changes
[source,shell]
----
git commit -m "Added new feature"
----

.Push Changes
[source,shell]
----
git push origin feature-branch
----


== Core Mindset Concepts (VCS)

*_This can also serve as a cheat sheet for Branching Strategies and Development Workflows._*

Separate Classes to Stories/Issues::
* A *Story* (or *Issue*) describes a user need, feature, or bug.
* A *Class* in code is a unit of implementation (object-oriented design).

=== The Basic Idea -- Separate Concerns!

_At the core of the philosophy is *the complete separation of concerns*._

==== How to Break Classes into Issues

. **Start with the User Story / Requirement**
.. *Example*: `"As a user, I want to register an account."`
. **Break It Down Into Technical Tasks**
.. Backend: Implement `User` class.
.. API: Create `RegisterUserController`.
.. Frontend: Build the registration form.
. **Create Issues per Responsibility**

.Class Mapping
====
[cols="2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Issue | Code Artifact
| Create a User model and validation | `User` class (Model)
| Implement registration business logic | `UserService` class
| Expose registration endpoint | `UserController` class
|===
====

Then done! -- Map Class Responsibilities to Issues::
* Each Issue tackles one behavior/responsibility, not necessarily just a single class.
* Focus on outcomes, not objects. Think *features*, not files.

==== How to Map Issues to Branches

Workflow::
* Each Issue typically corresponds to one branch (sometimes more for big tasks).

Naming Convention Example::
[cols="2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Item | Example
| Issue | #42 Add Login Form
| Branch Name | feature/login-form-42
|===

Steps::
. Create an Issue: "Add Login Form (#42)"
. Create a Branch for the Issue: +
`git checkout -b feature/login-form-42`
. *_Work_*, *_Commit_*, and *_Reference_* the Issue in your commit messages: +
`git commit -m "Add login controller (#42)"`
. *_Push_* the evolved *_Branch_* for all to see: +
`git push origin feature/login-form-42`

=== What is Trunk-Based Development (TBD)?

IMPORTANT: This is probably the most important topic to understand.

Definition -- TBD is a branching model where developers::
* Work in short-lived branches NOT directly on the mainline, i.e., `main` or `trunk`.
* Merge back to the mainline frequently -- i.e., multiple times per day.
* The business current state, i.e., `production` IS the mainline!

Examples of massive companies that use TBD:::
* Google
* Facebook
* LinkedIn

Key Practices::
* Small, incremental changes ->
* Continuous integration ->
* Feature flags (for incomplete or long features) ->
* Fewer branches, *_no "long-lived branches antipattern"_* ->
* *Lean Enterprise!*

Why Use TBD?::
* ✅ Faster delivery;
* ✅ No "merge hell";
* ✅ Forces test-first mindset;
* ✅ Forces continuous integration;
* ✅ Simplified, faster releases;
* ✅ Works well with CI/CD pipelines.

Why Feature Branches Are Short-Lived:::
🧐 A *_Feature Branch_* is a branch used to develop a *_tiny and specific feature or fix_*.

Why Keep Them Short-Lived?:::
* **Removed Merge Conflicts** eliminate delivery creep and cascade blocking ->
** _Long-lived branches drift from `main`, making merges painful._
* **Continuous Integration** minimizes delivery time and cost ->
** Short branches integrate changes early and often, avoiding complexity blockers.
* **Increased Code Review Speed** eliminates natural scheduling barriers ->
** Smaller pull requests are easier to review needing no timeblock shuffles.
* **Fast Feedback** eliminates tribal knowledge blockage ->
** Smaller changes are easier to socialize, understand, and validate.

Ideal Lifetime:::
- ✅ Hours to a couple of days -> NO OVERHEAD!
- ❌ Few days, weeks, or months -> MERGE HELL!

=== What is a Pull Request (PR)?

*Definition -- _A Pull Request (PR) is a formal request to merge code from one branch into another branch._*

Importantly!::
- PR has *_one and only one_* OWNER (accountable person);
- OWNER asks for HELP from REVIEWERS (responsible people);
- *_reviewers_* WORK FOR *the owner* by offering HELP -- _not the other way around_;
- the owner benefits from the reviewers and should pay it forward.

What Happens in a PR?::
. Push a branch to GitHub.
. Create a Pull Request:
* Describe what was done.
* Link ALL related Issues.
. Reviewers check:
* Code quality;
* Test coverage;
* Functionality;
. Merge when approved.

WARNING:: Approval is for the work iem, i.e., CODE, not the person, i.e., the OWNER.

PR Workflow Example:::
. Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/signup-page`
. Push and open PR:
* From `feature/signup-page` ➡️ to `main`
* PR triggers:
** Code review,
** CI tests,
. Merge when approved.
. Merge to `trunk` triggers BUSINESS UPGRADES.

=== What is a `Forever Branch`?

Definition -- A *Forever Branch* is::
* A long-lived branch that persists indefinitely.
** Examples: `main`, `develop`.
* Is the company current state, i.e., `production`.
* It is continuously deployed (and asynchronously).

Forever Branch vs Feature Branch::
[cols="3,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Branch Type | Lifetime | Usage
| Forever | Permanent | `main`, `trunk`
| Feature | Short-lived | `feature/login-page`, `bugfix/api-crash`
|===

== Why Do All This? (Branching Strategies, Short-Lived Feature Branches, PRs, etc.)

Why Branch? -- COST and TIME Savings::
* Isolation: Work on features without breaking others.
* Parallel development.
* Safer experimentation.

Why Short-Lived Feature Branches? -- COST and COMPLEXITY Savings::
* Reduces merge conflicts.
* Enables faster feedback.
* Encourages Continuous Integration (CI).
* Easier reviews and smaller pull requests.

Why Pull Requests? -- FUNCTIONALITY and QUALITY Savings::
* Code quality: Peer review.
* Catch bugs earlier.
* Improve collaboration.
* Enforce CI pipelines before merge.

Why Trunk-Based Development or Forever Branches? -- ALL of the above::
* Simplifies release management.
* Always have stable, deployable code on `main`.
* Keeps teams in sync with a shared history.

== ✅ Quick Practice Summary

[cols="2,4", options="header"]
|===
| Question | Quick Answer
| Separate classes to issues | Map user stories ➡️ tasks ➡️ classes/components per issue.
| Map issues to branches | Create a branch per issue; use naming conventions like `feature/login-42`.
| Trunk-Based Development | Commit small, fast, frequent changes to `main`, no long-lived feature branches.
| Why feature branches are short-lived | Reduce merge conflicts, speed up reviews, support CI/CD, improve delivery speed.
| What is a Pull Request? | A proposal to merge code; includes review, testing, and approval.
| What is a Forever Branch? | Permanent branches (`main`, `trunk`) that always exist and are stable.
| Why do this? | Improve quality, reduce risk, speed up releases, and maintain stable codebases.
