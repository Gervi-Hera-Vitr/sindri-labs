== Collecting Business Contacts
We will have to check:
Emails, LinkedIn, Old Resumes, Phone contacts, Other contacts, Colleges, Recruiters and ect.

Ensure Each Contact Has the Following Details:

Name +
Company Name +
Industry +
Email Address +
Phone Number (if available) +
Job Title +
Service Type (Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Freelance, Networking, etc.) +
Last Contacted Date +

== Create a Google Spreadsheet to Store Contacts

Open Google Sheets and create a new document. +
Add column headers: +
Contact Name +
Company +
Industry +
Email +
Phone +
Job Title +
Service Type +
Priority (High, Medium, Low) +
Notes (Last Contact, Follow-Up Date, etc.) +

Enter all collected contacts into the spreadsheet. +

Use Sorting and Filtering Tools to quickly organize contacts. +

Save the spreadsheet in Google Drive for easy access and backup. +

== Import Contacts into Google Contacts for Easy Management

Open Google Contacts. +

Click "Import" on the left menu. +

Select Google CSV as the file format. +

Upload the Google Spreadsheet CSV to add all contacts to Google
Contacts. +

Click Import and wait for processing. +

== Categorize Contacts with Labels in Google Contacts

Open Google Contacts and select the imported contacts. +

Click ‚ÄúCreate label‚Äù in the left sidebar. +

Name the labels according to categories (Recruiters, Tech Companies,  Networking, Freelance Work, etc.). +

Assign each contact to the appropriate label for easy searching. +

Use the Search Bar in Google Contacts to filter contacts by label,  company, or priority. +

== Enable Google Workspace Directory for Shared Access

For Google Workspace Admin (if applicable)

Open Google Admin Console (Admin Console).

Click "Apps" ‚Üí "Google Workspace" ‚Üí "Directory".

Click "Sharing settings" and enable ‚ÄúContact sharing‚Äù.

Configure access levels:

Everyone in the organization (for company-wide access)

Specific Groups (for team-specific contacts)

Click Save.

Team members can now access shared contacts in the "Directory" section of Google Contacts.

== Share & Manage Contacts Across Accounts
Use Google Workspace Directory (Best for Teams)

If all shared contacts need to be accessible within an organization, the Google Workspace Directory is the best option.

Contacts remain updated in real time and do not need to be manually shared.
