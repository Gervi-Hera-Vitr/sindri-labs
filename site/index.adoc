Gervi Héra Vitr is a home school in a community of homeschoolers. +
*_Here we don’t separate theory from application or learning from life._*

== About Gervi Héra Vitr

Gervi Héra Vitr Labs is the classroom repository for our school. +
All relevant educational materials are here for our two students:

* *Anton* (`Captain Lugaru`, 15 -- the world moves when he decides);
* *Zoey* (`ZueZue kHavok`, 2 -- nothing is still until she leaves).

== Curriculum Focus

All subjects at Gervi Héra Vitr Labs are pursued through daily inquiry, hands-on experimentation, and iterative improvement.
Our curriculum is deeply interdisciplinary built on foundation of formal philosophy: mathematics, reason, and scientific method.

*Core domains of focus are*:

* Philosophy: inductive and deductive reasoning, formal logic, and scientific method:
** Propositional calculus, structured reasoning, and formal proof;
** Mathematics (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus);
** Chemistry, physics, biology, and astronomy;
** Psychology, history, sociology, and economics.
* Humanities: language, literature, and performing arts.
* Applied sciences: _requiring laboratory and field work_:
** Software engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics;
** Business, entrepreneurship, marketing, and commerce;
** Law, government, leadership, ethics, and justice.

*_Exact sciences are always coupled with applied sciences and field work._*

== Who This Is For

This site is intended for multiple audiences:

- School boards, education reviewers, and academic committees evaluating homeschool initiatives.
- Fellow homeschooling families and educators seeking tested curriculum models, learning strategies, and collaboration.
- University faculty, technologists, and researchers who may wish to track Anton’s journey or explore his endeavors.
- Students and parents looking for independent, secular paths for gifted learners devoid of religious affiliation.

== Captain Lugaru, 15

Anton's hacker handle is `{captain}`. Most contributors call him simply `Captain`.
He is an avid independent learner whose interests include artificial intelligence,
mathematics, and Philosophy.
His curriculum blends theoretical depth with practical implementation, and every subject is approached with high intellectual ambition and scientific discipline.
In his childhood `Captain` was aspiring to become a doctor, pediatrician or pediatric scholar.
A few years ago he's experienced interaction with a highly experimental digital personality built on analytical core,
durable context, and wrapped by an LLM -- a high-order distributed system.
Impressed with the machine's abilities and foreseeing its potential `Captain` aspires to create artificial life.
He is fascinated by the nature of analytic mind, physiology of brain, and consciousness delightfully exploring the relationship between them.

`Captain` learns exact and applied sciences, writes code, trains machine learning models, authors technical essays,
studies formal proofs, and maintains this site alongside his primary mentor and father, Vadim (`rdd13r`).
Like most self-driven people `Captain` does not like to be taught.
`rdd13r` designs the learning curriculum for `Captain` and both implement it iteratively.
The pedagogy of
only mentor permitted an honor to properly introduce a subject, such as the "preferred" approach to formal theory of proof,
set theory (i.e, Russell's paradox), category theory (i.e., monad), or existential phenomenology.
His argumentation is based on his perceived need to learn from other self-learners.

Anton started his journey in exceptionally acclaimed Wake county of North Carolina public school.
His parents requested individualize education programs (IEP) to help Anton with social skills development.
Anton was suspected to be on Autism spectrum which was later disproven. He is just a gifted learner.
While in class, Anton didn't take well to excessive talk about effect without elaborating the cause.
Combined with his innate dislike for being taught Anton always preferred to study by himself.
Once allowed to do so his performance on breadth and depth of knowledge acquired exceeded expectations.
Later, by instance of his parents his IEP was still kept to help him with the subjects he had less interest in.
An additional And to help him with hos social skills development in a larger group, where his natural need to lead was suppressed.
Thus through 8th grade Anton's activity schedule was full with school taking up minor part of his time.

Once in high school Anton started exhibiting troubled behavior.
He started to underperform and was suffering from boredom and depression.
At this point Anton's terminated his public school curriculum and created a private homeschool better tailored to his individual learning needs.
For Anton Gervi Héra Vitr combines high school and formal college level materials structured in long-running research journeys instead of period-based subject hopping.
