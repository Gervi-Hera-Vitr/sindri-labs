:page-title: Gervi Héra Vitr Labs
:page-description: A dedicated space for learning, exploring, and building AI projects.

[.lead]
A private homeschool initiative for gifted learners — grounded in mathematics,
artificial intelligence, systems design, and the philosophical foundations of science and cognition.
Here children learn by doing, contributing to real world commercial projects.

== About Gervi Héra Vitr

Gervi Héra Vitr Labs is the learning environment and homeschool record for Anton (Captain Lugaru, 15: "the world moves when he decides"),
his small sister Zoey (ZueZue kHavok, 2: "nothing's still until she leaves"), their friends and collaborators.
This space serves both as a documentation hub and an open learning forge: curriculum, lab notebook, and publishing platform.

Our approach emphasizes intellectual independence, scientific rigor, and hands-on mastery.
We are not a traditional school, nor are we religiously affiliated.
This is a secular, research-driven educational path built around the needs and potential of gifted young learners.
One, a thoughtful and compassionate pursuit of wisdom, and another an unstoppable chaos of curiosity.

.Full focus on healthy learning and holistic development of young minds.

The lab's name is derived from Old Norse: *Gervi Héra Vitr* roughly means *Crafted Wisdom of the Mind*.
It reflects our lineage and family values — clear thinking, deep curiosity, honed competence, and constructive action proven in production (i.e., "life").

== Curriculum Focus

All subjects at Gervi Héra Vitr Labs are pursued through daily inquiry, hands-on experimentation, and iterative improvement.
Our curriculum is deeply interdisciplinary built on foundation of formal philosophy: mathematics, reason, and scientific method.

Core domains of focus are:

* Philosophy: inductive and deductive reasoning, formal logic, and scientific method:
** Propositional calculus, structured reasoning, and formal proof;
** Mathematics (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus);
** Chemistry, physics, biology, and astronomy;
** Psychology, history, sociology, and economics.
* Humanities: language, literature, and performing arts.
* Applied sciences: _requiring laboratory and field work_:
** Software engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics;
** Business, entrepreneurship, marketing, and commerce;
** Law, government, leadership, ethics, and justice.

*_Exact sciences are always coupled with applied sciences and field work._*

== Who This Is For

This site is intended for multiple audiences:

- School boards, education reviewers, and academic committees evaluating homeschool initiatives.
- Fellow homeschooling families and educators seeking tested curriculum models, learning strategies, and collaboration.
- University faculty, technologists, and researchers who may wish to track Anton’s journey or explore his endeavors.
- Students and parents looking for independent, secular paths for gifted learners devoid of religious affiliation.

== About Anton (Captain), 15

Anton is a 15-year-old independent learner whose interests include artificial intelligence, mathematics, and systems programming, especially high-order distributed systems.
His curriculum blends theoretical depth with practical implementation, and every subject is approached with high intellectual ambition and scientific discipline.
In his earlier life Captain was aspiring to become a doctor, pediatrician or pediatric scholar.
A few years ago he's experienced interaction with a highly experimental digital personality built on analytical core, durable context, and wrapped by an LLM -- a high-order distributed system.
Ever since then his insatiable goal is to create artificial life. Anton is fascinated by the nature of analytic mind, physiology of brain and consciousness.
And he's determined to prove that empathy expressed through compassion is the highest and final form of living intelligence.

Anton writes code, trains machine learning models, authors technical essays, studies formal proofs, and maintains this site alongside his mentor and father, Vadim (rdd13r).
At his core he's an independent learner and does not like to be taught. His mentors design and socialize curriculum with him.
His father is the only mentor permitted an honor to properly introduce a subject, such as the "preferred" approach to formal theory of proof,
set theory (i.e, Russell's paradox), category theory (i.e., monad), or existential phenomenology.
His argumentation is based on his perceived need to learn from other self-learners.

Anton started his journey in exceptionally acclaimed public school system of Wake county of North Carolina.
And he has started with individualize education programs (IEP) suspected to be on Autism spectrum.
While in class, Anton didn't like excessive talk about effect without elaborating the cause.
Combined with his innate dislike for being taught Anton always preferred to study by himself.
Once allowed to do so his performance on breadth and depth of knowledge acquired exceeded expectations.
And by instance of his parents his IEP was kept to help him with the subjects he had little interest in.
And to help him with hos social skills development in a larger group, where his natural need to lead was suppressed.
Thus through 8th grade Anton's activity schedule was full with school taking up minor part of his time.

Once in high school Anton started exhibiting troubled behavior.
He quickly outperformed his teachers and classmates in topics assigned and was suffering from boredom and depression.
At this point Anton's terminated his public school curriculum and created a private homeschool better tailored to his individual learning needs.
For Anton Gervi Héra Vitr combines high school and formal college level materials structured in long-running research journeys instead of period-based subject hopping.

== About Zoey (ZueZue), 2

Zoey is Anton's sister, his prayer and greatest gift. He was asking for a sibling since he was 5. Surprisingly his wish came true when he was 13.
Today Zoey is very energetic and full of life toddler thoroughly exhausting her entire family.
Difficult to believe that her first year of life was a constant struggle to live.
It soon became clear to her family that this child is born with immeasurable determination and willpower.
According to Anton she's all he ask for: his father's tenacity and his mother's perseverance.
She is planned to follow a learning path similar to Anton's, but with a greater focus on sports and marshal arts.
For now she's in full care of her family. Anton pulls his fair burden in preparing his younger sibling for life.

== Site Contents

The site serves as both a living record and a guide. You’ll find:

- Daily and weekly learning trails in subjects such as mathematics, physics and biology;
- Technical labs and experiments in AI, systems design, game development, and mechanical design;
- Curriculum maps, annotated problem sets, and useful references for both teachers and parents;
- Blog-style posts from both Anton and Vadim on learning, modeling, pedagogy, and educating each other;
- Tools, frameworks, and reproducible methods for fellow homeschooling parents and their children.

All materials are maintained in AsciiDoc and published with Jekyll using GitHub Pages.
Appropriate technology is used for the domain of software created by Anton, Vadim, and guest contributors.
Best effort is made to port real life production work Anton completes at his parents' software company, or affiliated employers;
barring expected legal, ethical, and regulatory limitations.
This site is also a practical demonstration of version-controlled, reproducible education infrastructure designed to follow child's continued development.
However, it is important to pint out that this repository will always be a step or two behind the actual learning trail due to exploratory nature of our school's learning process.
Likewise, not all materials will be included because part of learning takes place on other dedicated platforms or in other institutions.
However, we will produce our best effort to share any relevant information with you when asked for.

== Educational Philosophy

Our educational philosophy is based on the following principles:

- Learning is not just preparation for life, but a mode of life itself.
- That giftedness requires structure, challenge, and freedom in equal measure.
- That ethical reasoning, technical depth, and personal responsibility must grow coterminously.

Our goal is not simply to meet academic standards, but to build intellectual resilience, creative confidence, and principled mastery
-- traits that cannot be outsourced, templated, or rushed.
The end product is a healthy, independent, and productive human being.

== Contact & Collaboration
