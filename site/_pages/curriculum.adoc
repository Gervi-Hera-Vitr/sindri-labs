We don’t teach for grades. We don't even have a classroom or a grading system. +
We build mastery through real work, tested in the field at real businesses. +
State and Federal offer a secondary assessment systems that kids enjoy beating. +
Most universities in the world offer a formal entry exam either private or public. +
Here, at Gervi Héra Vitr, kids have office, shop, and lab space; tools, machines, and toys. +
_Most importantly, here kids have freedom to learn, to create, to make mistakes, and grow._

== Overview

The Gervi Héra Vitr curriculum is interdisciplinary, iterative, adaptive, and incremental. +
All learning is contextualized in real work on real _assets_ and is completely salf-paced. +
There are no semesters, quarters, periods, school years or any other superficial timeframes. +
As in colonial times kids learn continuously regardless of "vacations" because life is continuous.

 Our kids keep a diary of their learning activities and reflections.

.Reflection and self-introspection are key to progressive development.

Each student progresses through high-agency _"learning trails"_ that *tightly combine*:

- *Core Scientific Theory*{daidai} (i.e, math, science, philosophy, etc.) -- the fundamentals of thinking;
- *Maker Practice*{zaizai} (i.e, projects, experiments, µSaaS production, etc.) -- science in motion;
- and, *Reflection*{captain} by introspection and retrospection (journals, essays, feedback, etc.).

== Core Domains

* #**Philosophy**#{daidai} -- logic, ethics, decision theory, Stoicism <- the foundations of science:
** **Mathematics** -- from arithmetic to calculus and proof;
** **Physics** -- from Newtonian mechanics to quantum mechanics and relativity;
** **Chemistry** -- from acids and bases to organic chemistry and biochemistry;
** **Biology** -- from microscopic life to macroscopic ecosystems and evolution;
** **Astronomy** -- from the Sun to the Universe and beyond;
** **Psychology** -- from cognitive psychology to social psychology and neuroscience.
* #**Applied Sciences**#{daidai}{zaizai} -- software engineering, artificial intelligence, robotics <- civilization:
** **Business** -- entrepreneurship, marketing, commerce && finance and personal finances;
** **Law & Government** -- herding structures, government forms, ethics, justice, lobbying;
** **Leadership & Ethics** -- volunteering, supporting democracy and independence fighters;
** **Engineering & AI** -- robotics, machine learning, component printing, circuit design.
* #**Humanities**#{zaizai} -- language, literature, poetry, history, and performing arts:
** **Systems & Society** -- law, civics, leadership, impact of innovation and adoption curve;
** **Languages** -- linguistics, language families and language learning, theory and practice;
** **Literature** -- poetry, prose, fiction, selected works of American and world authors;
** **Performing Arts** — composition, improvisation, choreography, comics, and drama.

== Methodology and Philosophy of Pedagogy

[.text-center]
 Mind is a temple. Treat it as one.

.Preparation is the key to the next successful day of learning.

* **No lectures. No tests. No busywork.**
* Lifelong continued learning is not an achievement but a fundamental necessity.
* There's no such thing as specialization or preferred focus:
** A real world objective is selected and the asset for it is created;
** Both theoretical and practical learning is applied together to create the asset;
** Progress is proven through the quality of the assets, not any "assignments."
* Every day uses the 80/20 rule to learn to optimize running productivity.

== School Year Concepts

- Learning never stops in real life -- no such things as a vacation from thinking.
- Breadth of knowledge trumps the depth of knowledge, especially for young adults.
- Social development trumps intellectual development, this is also more difficult for home schooled kids.

Considering these factors we use a _"learning trail"_ approach to learning:

- Satisfy just the minimum amount of time state required for children to learn each week;
- Prefer immersive learning integrated with social activities over formalized sit-down study;
- Make all learning activities fun, interesting, and objective based on real world assets.

== Curriculum Artifacts

All learning trails and work artifacts live in the GitHub curriculum folder:
