= Curriculum

We don’t teach for grades. We build mastery through real work, tested in the field.

== Overview

The Gervi Héra Vitr curriculum is interdisciplinary and adaptive.
Each student progresses through high-agency learning trails that combine:

- theory (math, science, philosophy),
- practice (projects, experiments, production),
- and reflection (journals, essays, analysis).

== Core Domains

* **Mathematics** — from arithmetic to calculus and proof
* **Philosophy** — logic, ethics, decision theory, Stoicism
* **Science** — physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy
* **Coding & AI** — Python, algorithms, ML models, LLMs
* **Business & Economics** — markets, incentives, entrepreneurship
* **Writing & Humanities** — literature, history, critical analysis
* **Systems & Society** — law, civics, leadership, governance

== Method

- **No lectures. No tests. No busywork.**
- Learning is the most important achievement
- Each subject begins with a challenge or need.
- Theory is introduced only when it’s time to apply it.
- Progress is proven through assets, not assignments.
- Every day uses the 90/20 rule to have the most productivity.

== Curriculum Artifacts

All learning trails and work artifacts live in the GitHub curriculum folder:
