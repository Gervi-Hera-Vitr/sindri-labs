Mímis academic year is *_planned by week numbers_* -- not calendar months.
_This *Ancient Norse School* follows a seasonal theme similar to year-around schools._

. Academy Instruction Year is yearlong.
. All Federal Holidays are observed.

== Academic Year Curriculum Schedule

The Academy Instruction Year is planned in three stages.

. Immediate -- a detailed plan for two (2) weeks of instruction.
. Tactical -- a topic plan for six (6) weeks of instruction.
. Strategic -- a topic-group plan for 36 to 52 weeks out.

Schedule Iteration 2.0.7 complete on #Week #28# of 2025.

== v3.0.0 (2025) Academic Year Schedule

* Week 28:
** STEM: LeetCode - {leetcode-programming-skills}[Programming Skills - Basic Implementation] section.
** Science: Introduction to Analysis, prelude to Newtonian Mechanics.
** Humanities: Matrix Trilogy.


#We're here: pending the rest of the year copied from notes.#


== Governing Dynamics of Structured Thought

> Captain, these are the deep structural forces that shape mathematics, computation, and symbolic minds. Some appeared in your journey. Others we'll meet later.

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Dynamic | What It Teaches | Representative Topics

| Truth & Proof
| Foundations of valid reasoning
| Frege, Hilbert, Gödel

| Computation & Constructibility
| What can be calculated and how
| Turing, Church, Tarski

| Structure & Relation
| Abstract objects and their interactions
| Set theory, algebra, category theory

| Infinity & Continuum
| Different sizes and kinds of infinity
| Cantor, Dedekind

| Information & Compression
| Meaning and minimal description
| Shannon, Kolmogorov, Chaitin

| Uncertainty & Belief
| Reasoning under doubt
| Bayes, Laplace, Turing (crypto)

| Language & Reference
| How symbols connect to meaning
| Frege, Russell, type theory

| Limits of Systems
| Boundaries of provability and computability
| Gödel, Turing, Rice’s Theorem

| Measurement & Modeling
| Mapping math onto the physical world
| Galileo, Maxwell, physics arc

| Recursion & Self-Reference
| Systems that refer to themselves
| Gödel, λ-calculus, fixed points

| Emergence & Generativity
| Simple rules → complex behavior
| Cellular automata, fractals, chaos

| Duality & Symmetry
| Inverses, mirrors, and balance
| Linear duals, group theory, Noether

[NOTE]
====
The first 8 dynamics are covered in the current journey or in parallel arcs (physics, logic, etc.).
The final 3 (recursion, emergence, duality) are *optional deeper arcs* you may revisit in future years.
