Most relevant documentation links::

- https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions[GitHub Actions: Jekyll]

Important tribal knowledge::

Traditionally, *_"GitHub Pages"_* support is a strongly locked-down affair.
This created many conflicts with Jekyll, various Gems, and GitHub Pages plugins.
The GitHub Pages Actions workflow is meant to partially alleviate the issue.

_I use Linux and Mac OS X. Linux users need no help but I will document the Mac OS X setup._

== Mac OS X Setup


*Use `asdf` to install `ruby`:*

[source,shell]
----
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

brew update && brew upgrade --greedy \
&& brew install coreutils curl asdf

----

=== Install latest `ruby` using `asdf`

'''

**Explanation 1: **

Please remember that `asdf` delegates to resource managers called plugins::
`asdf` manage tool artifacts *_via dedicated plugins_* that fully control the lifecycle or SDKs they manage.

- Here is the https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html['Getting Started' guide] for `asdf`;
- documentation on https://asdf-vm.com/manage/core.html[core] functionality;
- and, TL;DR on https://asdf-vm.com/manage/plugins.html[plugins] and https://asdf-vm.com/manage/versions.html[version] management.


- *Example:* To #list# all plugins, use:
[source,shell]
----
asdf plugin list all
----

- *Example:* To #upgrade# all plugins, use:
[source,shell]
----
asdf plugin update --all
----

'''

*Step 1:* Install `ruby` plugin (see https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby[the `ruby` home repository] to get the sense of plugins):

[source,shell]
----
asdf plugin add ruby
----

*Step 2:* Then, install the latest `ruby`:

[source,shell]
----
asdf install ruby latest
----

*Step 3:* Verify:

[source,shell]
----
asdf current
----

== Install Jekyll and GitHub Pages dependencies

#Navigate into your project docs directory before working on Jekyll site!#

Follow the https://jekyllrb.com/docs/[Jekyll Quickstart] documentation.

[source,shell]
----
cd site
gem install jekyll bundler
jekyll new site --force
bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve -wolIVt

----

== That's it!

We have then modified our site to apply https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes[Minimal Mistakes] Jekyll theme.
