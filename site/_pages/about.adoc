= About Gervi Héra Vitr Labs

Gervi Héra Vitr is a homeschool in Cary North Carolina.
And this site is its classroom and laboratory repository.
Our curriculum is built by parents, mentors, and students.
We care deeply about children’s development, autonomy, and competence.
This site is backed by a GitHub repository and hosted on GitHub Pages.

[.lead]
*We raise thinkers, builders, and leaders +
{nbsp}{nbsp} -- not products of any system.*

== Our Mission

- Build intellectual resilience.
- Cultivate ethical reasoning.
- Develop technical depth.
- Forge real-world competence.
- Test through hands-on creation.
- Share our experiences openly.

== Our Method

Gervi Héra Vitr combines foundational theory with relentless application.
All learning culminates in a tangible result.
Acceptable outcomes are consequential to the learner.
Possible assets are an artifact, a product contribution, a business transaction.
The learning environment is a Socratic classroom. +
*_A completely flat hierarchy_*: +
_parents are equal learners to their children_.

Children do not "study subjects."
They pursue long arcs of discovery, production, and self-directed inquiry
-- helped by mentors, powered by curiosity, and tested against reality.

== A Final Word

We share this forge with the hope that other families
-- educators, researchers, and mentors
-- may benefit, collaborate, or contribute to this work.

We're not running a school.
We're raising future elders,
founders, warriors, and scientists
-- one battle-fire-tested soul at a time.
