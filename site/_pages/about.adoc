= About Gervi Héra Vitr Labs

Gervi Héra Vitr is a homeschool in North Carolina.
And this site is its classroom and laboratory repository.
Our curriculum is built by parents and mentors who take full responsibility for their children’s development, autonomy, and future competence.
Relevant resources are available on this site and its hosting GitHub repository.

*We raise thinkers, builders, and leaders — not products of a system.*

== Our Mission

- Build intellectual resilience.
- Cultivate ethical reasoning.
- Develop technical depth.
- Forge real-world competence through hands-on creation.
- Share our knowledge and experience.

== Our Method

Gervi Héra Vitr combines foundational theory with relentless application.
All learning culminates in a tangible result — an artifact, a contribution, a decision that matters.

Children do not “study subjects.”
They pursue long arcs of discovery, production, and self-directed inquiry — guided by mentors, powered by curiosity, and tested against reality.

== A Final Word

We share this forge with the hope that other families — educators, researchers, and mentors — might benefit, collaborate, or contribute to this work.

We're not building a school.
We're building future elders, founders, warriors, and scientists — one fire-tested soul at a time.
