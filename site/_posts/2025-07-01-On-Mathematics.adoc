_This is how I organized my research into the fields of mathematics._

I have reviewed many resources available online and in print.
My father's key stipulation was the grasp on fundamentals.
None of "go do that when you have this."
But a real understanding of a topic requiring *_no mechanical memorization_*.
My father is really strict in separating what he calls mastery from coggery.

Interestingly enough, the best resource I found is a YouTube channel.
{youtube-channel-domain-of-science}.
It offered an overview video: {youtube-the-map-of-math}.
Exactly what I was looking for, validated by the research I'd already done.

My father immediately approved the channel: "... something a homeschooling parent would build."

== About the Channel "Domain of Science (DoS)"

Domain of Science is a science‑education YouTube channel created and hosted by Dr.{nbsp}Dominic{nbsp}Walliman,
a Canadian physicist with a Ph.D. in quantum device physics, formerly with D-Wave.

- Launch date: Channel created on April 8, 2010
- Subscribers: ~1.55 million
- Total views: ~64 million

Content focus::
Explains complex scientific disciplines—like physics, math, chemistry, biology, engineering—through visual “maps” and simplified explanations.

Creator Background::
Dominic Walliman, Ph.D. in quantum device physics, is also the author of the Professor Astro Cat children’s book series;
produces scientific posters sold via stores and on Flickr.
His signature content on DoS is the “Maps” series -- illustrated overviews of entire disciplines:
Map of Physics, Map of Mathematics, Map of Chemistry, Map of Biology, Map of Engineering, Map of Medicine, Map of Quantum Computing, etc.
His special work is explanatory videos on quantum physics topics: e.g., Quantum Supremacy, Quantum Computing Misconceptions is breathtaking.
He also has exceptionally well written and narrated episodes on scientific installations and phenomena: e.g.,
Behind the Scenes at CERN, Atomic Spectroscopy Explained.
As researcher he's featured in articles praising the “Map of Physics” visualization — e.g., on Sciencealert.com and Physics says what? (blog)
And this channel is listed among top science channels for quantum physics by blogs and curators.

Style & Format::
Visual-rich, data-driven diagrams and animations—often from Walliman’s own design work.
Concise, high-level surveys rather than deep technical dives—ideal for overview learnings.
The lecturer tone balances rigorous science background with friendly delivery, appealing to both students and science enthusiasts.

Who is this Channel For::
Learners who want a holistic understanding of a scientific field.
Visual learners who benefit from conceptual maps and diagrams.
Fans of quantum mechanics, modern physics, or interdisciplinary science explained clearly.

Summary::
Oh yeah, *_dad approved_*. Not only approved, my father was ecstatic and reviewed many lectures on his own.
"Cleanly delineated Domains of Science combine academic rigor and visual storytelling, offering engaging, map-based overviews of scientific topics."
Built on Dominic Walliman’s expertise and creativity, it’s a standout among science education channels,
with over 1.5 million subscribers and strong community recognition, "something one would not expect from plebs."
