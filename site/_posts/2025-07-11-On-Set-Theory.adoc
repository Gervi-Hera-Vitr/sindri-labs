The Axiomatic Set Theory is an exact discipline, that is a Domain of Mathematics,
defined by a set of non-logical axioms, like all formal domains are.

Non-logical axioms forming the domain of Formal Set Theory (Axiomatic Set theory):

. Unrestricted Composition.
. Set identity is membership.
. Order Does not matter.
. Repeats Dont change anything.
. Description Does not matter.
. The union of any sets is a set.
. And a subset is a set.
. A set can have just 1 member.
. A set can have no members.
. A set of sets is a set.
. Sets can contain themselves.

A paradox is a self-contradictory statement or proposition.
And Russell's paradox is a paradox in core logic itself as "is not true of itself" is the linguistic way of thinking about this paradox, in terms of predicates.
Using above predicate I can prove that Russell's paradox is not just a paradox within the Set Theory but a paradox that "just exists," i.e, in core logic.

== Summary

Russell's Paradox demonstrates a contradiction arising in Axiomatic Set Theory.
It explores the idea of a set containing all sets that do not contain themselves.
It can also be explained in terms of Naive Set Theory.
And demonstrated in Linguistics using predicates.
