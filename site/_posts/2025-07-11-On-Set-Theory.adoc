The Axiomatic Set Theory is an exact discipline, that is a Domain of Mathematics,
defined by a set of non-logical axioms, like all formal domains are.

1. Unrestricted Composition
2. Set identity is membership
3. Order Does not matter
4. Repeats Dont change anything
5. Description Does not matter
6. The union of any sets is a set
7. and subset is a set
8. A set can have just 1 member
9. A set can have no members
10. You can have sets of sets
11. sets can contain themselves

A paradox is aself-contradictory statement or proposition, And russells paradox is a paradox in core logic itself as "is not true of itself" is the lingusitic way of thinking about this paradox.

== Summary

Russell's paradox:: demonstrates a contradiction arising in naive set theory. It explores the idea of a set containing all sets that do not contain themselves.
