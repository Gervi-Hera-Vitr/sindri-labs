Dear Munchkin Friends,

This is _the beginning ouf our journey_ through the wonderful world of AI, science, engineering, and coding.
My mother finally said "Okay, let's do this."
And my father created my School, where my sister and I are principal students.
My School organization is {anton-school} from *Mímis Gildi Academy* that my parents have registered with the state.
Best of all it is managed by my parents organization {mimis-publishing} where I access massive amounts of engineering and AI knowledge.

My principal instructor is {rdd13r}, my father.
And I no longer have to deal with a political history teacher who worships Russia.
And I don't need to worry about silly social rankings of lazy students.

Welcome, Friend and lets have a creative time together.

Sincerely yours,

{captain}
