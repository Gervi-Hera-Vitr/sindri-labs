[.lead]
The theory of computation is a branch of theoretical computer science and mathematics that explores what problems can be solved using algorithms on computational models and how efficiently these problems can be solved.

It is structured into three primary branches:

- Automata theory and formal languages.
- Computability theory.
- Computational complexity theory.

== Models of Computation

To study computation rigorously, theoretical models such as the Turing machine are used.
The Turing machine is central to the Church–Turing thesis, which posits it as the most powerful reasonable model of computation.

Other notable models include:

- Lambda calculus.
- Combinatory logic.
- μ-recursive functions.
- Markov algorithms.
- Register machines.

== Automata Theory

Automata theory deals with abstract machines and the problems they can solve. Key types of automata, corresponding to classes of languages in the Chomsky hierarchy, include:

- Type-0 (Recursively enumerable): Turing machines.
- Type-1 (Context-sensitive): Linear-bounded automata.
- Type-2 (Context-free): Pushdown automata.
- Type-3 (Regular): Finite automata.

Automata are closely tied to formal languages, serving as models to generate or recognize them.

== Formal Language Theory

Formal languages are defined over alphabets using a set of rules.
They are classified in the Chomsky hierarchy and recognized by different types of automata.
This theory provides a foundational framework for specifying problems to be solved computationally.

== Computability Theory

This branch studies the limits of algorithmic problem-solving.

It addresses what problems are solvable in principle:

- The Halting Problem: A central result proving some problems are unsolvable by any Turing machine.
- Rice's Theorem: Any non-trivial property of the function computed by a Turing machine is undecidable.
- Related to recursion theory, which generalizes Turing-computability.

== Computational Complexity Theory

This field examines the efficiency of algorithms. Major concepts include:

- Time and space complexity.
- Big O notation.
- Complexity classes like P and NP.
- The P vs NP problem: One of the Millennium Prize Problems.

Complexity theory categorizes problems based on the resources required for their solution.

== Summary

The theory of computation provides a formal basis for understanding what can be computed and how efficiently.
It blends logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science to explore the capabilities and limitations of computational models and algorithms.
