Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which can be informally described as collections of objects.

`collections` *of* `objects`

Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory
-- as a branch of mathematics
-- is mostly concerned with sets relevant to mathematics.

_A `set` is a `collection` of objects (`elements`)._

These elements can be numbers, symbols, _other sets_, etc.

== 1. Definition and Notation

=== What is a Set?

A set is a well-defined collection of distinct elements.

.Two `sets` defined:
====

 A = {1, 2, 3}

 B = {a, b, c}

====

=== Membership Symbols

* `∈` means "is an element of": `2 ∈ A`
* `∉` means "is not an element of": `4 ∉ A`

=== Set Builder Notation

Used when listing all elements is impractical.

----
P = {p | p is prime}
----

== 2. Equality of Sets

Two sets are equal if they contain the same elements, regardless of order or repetition.

----
A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 1, 2, 2} ⇒ A = B
----

== 3. Cardinality (Size of a Set)

The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in it.

Denoted as `|A|`

----
|A| = 3
----

.Infinite set example
====
 The set of prime numbers has cardinality ∞
====

== 4. Subsets

 Set A is a subset of B if every element of A is also in B.

`A ⊆ B`

=== Proper Subset

If A is a subset of B but not equal to B:

`A ⊂ B`

== 5. The Empty Set

The empty set is a set with no elements.

----
∅ or {}
----

.Properties
* `∅ ⊆ A` for any set A
* Unique: there is only one empty set

== 6. Union and Intersection

=== Union

All elements from both sets:

----
A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}
----

=== Intersection

Only elements common to both sets:

----
A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}
----

=== Properties

* Commutative: `A ∪ B = B ∪ A`, `A ∩ B = B ∩ A`
* Associative: `(A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)`

=== Identities

* `A ∪ ∅ = A`
* `A ∩ ∅ = ∅`

== 7. Set Difference and Complement

=== Difference

----
A \ B = {x ∈ A | x ∉ B}
----

=== Complement

The set of all elements not in `A` _within_ a given universal set `U`:

----
Aᶜ = U \ A
----

== 8. De Morgan's Laws

----
(A ∪ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∩ Bᶜ
(A ∩ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ
----

_These laws relate complements to unions and `intersections`._

== 9. Power Sets and Sets of Sets

=== Power Set

The set of all subsets of a set A:

----
𝒫(A)
----


----
A = {0, 1} ⇒ 𝒫(A) = {∅, {0}, {1}, {0,1}}
----

=== Sets of Sets

Sets can contain other sets as elements.

== 10. Russell's Paradox

----
Ω = {x | x ∉ x}
----

If `Ω ∈ Ω`, then `Ω ∉ Ω`

If `Ω ∉ Ω`, then `Ω ∈ Ω`

Leads to a paradox. 'Solved' using axiomatic set theory with strict rules (axioms).

See article on Sets -- i.e., NOT solved!

== 11. Practical Applications

Set theory is used in:

* Mathematical logic
* Computer science
* Probability
* Database systems
* Defining logical statements and predicates

== Summary

* Set = collection of elements
* Notation: curly brackets `{}`, `∈`, `∉`, `|A|`
* Set Builder: `{x ∈ A | condition}`
* Empty set: `∅`, subset of all sets
* Union / Intersection: `∪`, `∩`
* Difference / Complement: `\`, `ᶜ`
* Equal sets: same elements regardless of order or repetition
* Power Set: all subsets
* Russell's Paradox: motivates axiomatic theory
