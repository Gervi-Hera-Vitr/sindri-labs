== What is Mathematical Logic?

Mathematical logic::
is a subfield of mathematics exploring formal systems in relation to the way we reason. It provides tools to analyze the structure of arguments, statements, and proofs.

Major subareas::
include model theory, proof theory, set theory, and recursion theory (also known as computability theory).
Research in mathematical logic commonly addresses the mathematical properties of formal systems of logic such as their expressive or deductive power.
However, it can also include uses of logic to characterize correct mathematical reasoning or to establish foundations of mathematics.

== What is Propositional Calculus?

Propositional calculus:: is a branch of logic. It is also called propositional logic.


Mathematical logic is also the study of truths in mathematical statements. These are called propositions — a claim that is either true or false. A mix of these create propositional logic.

Example of a proposition: `2 + 2 = 4`
This can only be either true or false.

== Notational Variants of Connectives in propositional calculus

These are some standard notations for propositional logic.

== Axioms

 Important point: accepted without proof.

=== Axioms: Foundations of Logical Reasoning

An axiom, also known as a postulate or assumption, is a statement accepted as true without proof.
It serves as a starting point for further reasoning and deductive processes.

In mathematics and logic, axioms are fundamental to building formal systems. They come in *two* main types.

==== Types of Axioms

 Logical and non-logical.

Logical Axioms::
are formulas within a formal language that are universally valid.
These are tautologies—statements that are always true regardless of the truth values of their components.
They form the backbone of logical systems.

Examples include:

`(A ^ B) => A`

`A => (A v B)`

Logical axioms provide the formal structure necessary for logical deductions and are typically used in propositional and predicate logic.

Non-Logical Axioms::
also known as postulates or proper axioms, these are domain-specific assertions used to define particular mathematical structures.
Unlike logical axioms, they are not universally valid but are accepted as true within the context of a specific mathematical theory.

Example: the {peano-axioms} from arithmetic

`∀x (S(x) ≠ 0)`

Meaning, "for all x, the successor of x is not zero."

This axiom is non-logical because:

- It depends on the interpretation of symbols like `0` and `S(x)`, the _successor function_.
- It makes a specific claim about natural numbers, not about general logical structure.

_In integer arithmetic non-logical axioms establish the foundational truths from which theorems of a specific theory are derived._

 In other words, our invented reasoning structures.

=== Common Axioms in Mathematics

Reflexive Axiom: Every entity is equal to itself.

- `a = a`

Transitive Axiom of Equality: Equality is transitive.

- *If* `a = b` *and* `b = c` , *then* `a = c`

Addition Axiom: Equal quantities added to equal quantities yield equal sums.

- *If* `a = b` *and* `c = d` , *then* `a + c = b + d`

 See the thruthfunctional connectives?!

==== Role in Mathematical Systems

Axioms form the basis of *_deductive reasoning_* in mathematics.
They allow mathematicians to derive theorems and build entire structures such as geometry
(e.g., Euclidean postulates) and number theory (e.g., Peano axioms). +
_Recall domains, i.e, fields of study, are created by non-logical axioms._

A well-chosen set of axioms ensures a consistent, complete,
and useful framework for exploring mathematical truths.
