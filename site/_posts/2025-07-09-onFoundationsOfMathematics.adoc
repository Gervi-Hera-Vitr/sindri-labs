== Mathematics and Logic

_This exploratory research work is graded A on July 10th, 2025._

=== What is Mathematical Logic?

Mathematical logic::
is a subfield of mathematics exploring formal systems in relation to the way we reason. It provides tools to analyze the structure of arguments, statements, and proofs.

Major subareas::
include model theory, proof theory, set theory, and recursion theory (also known as computability theory).
Research in mathematical logic commonly addresses the mathematical properties of formal systems of logic such as their expressive or deductive power.
However, it can also include uses of logic to characterize correct mathematical reasoning or to establish foundations of mathematics.

=== What is Propositional Calculus?

Propositional calculus:: is a branch of logic. It is also called propositional logic.


Mathematical logic is also the study of truths in mathematical statements. These are called propositions — a claim that is either true or false. A mix of these create propositional logic.

Example of a proposition: `2 + 2 = 4`
This can only be either true or false.

== Axioms

 Important point: accepted without proof.

=== Axioms: Foundations of Logical Reasoning

An axiom, also known as a postulate or assumption, is a statement accepted as true without proof.
It serves as a starting point for further reasoning and deductive processes.

In mathematics and logic, axioms are fundamental to building formal systems. They come in *two* main types.

==== Types of Axioms

 Logical and non-logical.

Logical Axioms::
are formulas within a formal language that are universally valid.
These are tautologies—statements that are always true regardless of the truth values of their components.
They form the backbone of logical systems.

Examples include:

`(A ^ B) => A`

`A => (A v B)`

Logical axioms provide the formal structure necessary for logical deductions and are typically used in propositional and predicate logic.

Non-Logical Axioms::
also known as postulates or proper axioms, these are domain-specific assertions used to define particular mathematical structures.
Unlike logical axioms, they are not universally valid but are accepted as true within the context of a specific mathematical theory.

Example: the {peano-axioms} from arithmetic

`∀x (S(x) ≠ 0)`

Meaning, "for all x, the successor of x is not zero."

This axiom is non-logical because:

- It depends on the interpretation of symbols like `0` and `S(x)`, the _successor function_.
- It makes a specific claim about natural numbers, not about general logical structure.

_In integer arithmetic non-logical axioms establish the foundational truths from which theorems of a specific theory are derived._

 In other words, our invented reasoning structures.

=== Common Axioms in Mathematics

Reflexive Axiom: Every entity is equal to itself.

- `a = a`

Transitive Axiom of Equality: Equality is transitive.

- *If* `a = b` *and* `b = c` , *then* `a = c`

Addition Axiom: Equal quantities added to equal quantities yield equal sums.

- *If* `a = b` *and* `c = d` , *then* `a + c = b + d`

 See the thruthfunctional connectives?!

==== Role in Mathematical Systems

Axioms form the basis of *_deductive reasoning_* in mathematics.
They allow mathematicians to derive theorems and build entire structures such as geometry
(e.g., Euclidean postulates) and number theory (e.g., Peano axioms). +
_Recall domains, i.e, fields of study, are created by non-logical axioms._

A well-chosen set of axioms ensures a consistent, complete,
and useful framework for exploring mathematical truths.

== Set Theory

=== Introduction to Set Theory

Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which can be informally described as collections of objects.

`collections` *of* `objects`

Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory
-- as a branch of mathematics
-- is mostly concerned with sets relevant to mathematics.

_A `set` is a `collection` of objects (`elements`)._

These elements can be numbers, symbols, _other sets_, etc.

=== 1. Definition and Notation

==== What is a Set?

A set is a well-defined collection of distinct elements.

.Two `sets` defined:
====

 A = {1, 2, 3}

 B = {a, b, c}

====

==== Membership Symbols

* `∈` means "is an element of": `2 ∈ A`
* `∉` means "is not an element of": `4 ∉ A`

==== Set Builder Notation

Used when listing all elements is impractical.

----
P = {p | p is prime}
----

=== 2. Equality of Sets

Two sets are equal if they contain the same elements, regardless of order or repetition.

----
A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 1, 2, 2} ⇒ A = B
----

=== 3. Cardinality (Size of a Set)

The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in it.

Denoted as `|A|`

----
|A| = 3
----

.Infinite set example
====
 The set of prime numbers has cardinality ∞
====

=== 4. Subsets

 Set A is a subset of B if every element of A is also in B.

`A ⊆ B`

==== Proper Subset

If A is a subset of B but not equal to B:

`A ⊂ B`

=== 5. The Empty Set

The empty set is a set with no elements.

----
∅ or {}
----

.Properties
* `∅ ⊆ A` for any set A
* Unique: there is only one empty set

=== 6. Union and Intersection

==== Union

All elements from both sets:

----
A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}
----

==== Intersection

Only elements common to both sets:

----
A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}
----

==== Properties

* Commutative: `A ∪ B = B ∪ A`, `A ∩ B = B ∩ A`
* Associative: `(A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)`

==== Identities

* `A ∪ ∅ = A`
* `A ∩ ∅ = ∅`

=== 7. Set Difference and Complement

==== Difference

----
A \ B = {x ∈ A | x ∉ B}
----

==== Complement

The set of all elements not in `A` _within_ a given universal set `U`:

----
Aᶜ = U \ A
----

=== 8. De Morgan's Laws

----
(A ∪ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∩ Bᶜ
(A ∩ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ
----

_These laws relate complements to unions and `intersections`._

=== 9. Power Sets and Sets of Sets

==== Power Set

The set of all subsets of a set A:

----
𝒫(A)
----


----
A = {0, 1} ⇒ 𝒫(A) = {∅, {0}, {1}, {0,1}}
----

==== Sets of Sets

Sets can contain other sets as elements.

=== 10. Russell's Paradox

----
Ω = {x | x ∉ x}
----

If `Ω ∈ Ω`, then `Ω ∉ Ω`

If `Ω ∉ Ω`, then `Ω ∈ Ω`

Leads to a paradox. 'Solved' using axiomatic set theory with strict rules (axioms).

See article on Sets -- i.e., NOT solved!

=== 11. Practical Applications

Set theory is used in:

* Mathematical logic
* Computer science
* Probability
* Database systems
* Defining logical statements and predicates

=== Summary

* Set = collection of elements
* Notation: curly brackets `{}`, `∈`, `∉`, `|A|`
* Set Builder: `{x ∈ A | condition}`
* Empty set: `∅`, subset of all sets
* Union / Intersection: `∪`, `∩`
* Difference / Complement: `\`, `ᶜ`
* Equal sets: same elements regardless of order or repetition
* Power Set: all subsets
* Russell's Paradox: motivates axiomatic theory





== Complexity Theory
=== Complexity Theory: An Overview

==== Introduction

Complexity theory is a collection of theoretical frameworks developed to model and analyze complex systems across diverse domains such as computer science, ecology, and engineering. These systems often exhibit behaviors and dynamics that defy traditional scientific methods rooted in linear and reductionist models.

As complexity has emerged as a universal feature of our world, a unified, though loosely structured, approach to its study has evolved. This overview organizes complexity theory into four primary areas: self-organization, nonlinear systems, network theory, and adaptive systems.

==== Self-Organization and Emergence

Self-organization refers to the formation of global order through local interactions without centralized control. Examples include bird flocks, financial markets, the brain, and social networks. Emergence describes how novel structures arise as simple components interact.

This area incorporates:

Information theory — interpreting organization in terms of entropy.

Physics — studies on synchronization and pattern formation.

Chemistry — models of dissipative and far-from-equilibrium systems.

Tools such as agent-based modeling help simulate how local rules give rise to emergent global patterns.

==== Nonlinear Systems and Chaos Theory

Nonlinear dynamics are inherent to most complex systems. Originating in mathematics and physics, this field examines how small changes can produce disproportionately large effects — exemplified by the butterfly effect.

Chaos theory challenged the Newtonian reliance on equilibrium and predictability, revealing that many real-world processes (ecosystem shifts, societal change) are governed by feedback loops and far-from-equilibrium dynamics.

==== Network Theory

Complex systems can often be represented as networks. Network theory offers mathematical tools (e.g., graph theory) to analyze how components are connected and how information, matter, or influence flows through them.

Applications include:

Financial contagion mapping

Global logistics

Socio-political interactions

This data-driven, computational approach moves beyond models toward real-time system visualization.

==== Adaptive Systems

Complex adaptive systems (CAS) consist of agents that learn, evolve, and adapt to each other. Examples include fish schools, markets, and international relations.

Key components:

Cybernetics — theories of regulation and control.

Game theory — models of interaction, competition, and cooperation.

Evolutionary theory — population-level adaptation over life cycles.

CAS research incorporates tools such as evolutionary game theory, fitness landscapes, and genetic algorithms.

==== Context and Significance

Complexity theory challenges the Newtonian worldview by addressing systems that are inherently nonlinear and not reducible to parts. Scholarpedia describes it as a "post-Newtonian paradigm" — a necessary shift as 21st-century science tackles ecological, economic, and sociopolitical complexity.

==== Summary

Complexity theory brings together diverse models and methods to understand how order, structure, and change emerge in highly interconnected and dynamic systems. Its four major frameworks — self-organization, nonlinear systems, network theory, and adaptive systems — form a foundation for studying complexity across scientific domains.

As a post-Newtonian science, it helps extend our understanding of nature and society beyond the limits of classical models.


== Category Theory
=== Introduction

Category theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with general structures and their interrelations. Initially developed to formalize concepts in algebraic topology, it has since become foundational across mathematics and increasingly influential in computer science, especially in functional programming and type theory.

=== What is Category Theory?

Category theory is often described as "the mathematics of mathematics." It abstracts and studies the structural features common to many mathematical theories. Instead of focusing on elements within structures, it focuses on the relationships (morphisms) between objects.

=== Structure of a Mathematical Theory

A typical mathematical theory consists of:

Semantics – The subject matter (e.g., symmetry, space).

Syntax – A formal language to reason about the semantics.

Category theory unifies various mathematical theories by providing a framework that emphasizes these relationships.

=== Categories, Objects, and Morphisms

A category consists of:

A class of objects.

A class of morphisms (arrows) between objects.

Each morphism has a source and a target. Morphisms can be composed, and this composition is associative. Every object has an identity morphism.

Example: In the category Set, objects are sets, and morphisms are functions between sets.

=== Functors

A functor is a map between categories that preserves structure:

It maps objects to objects.

It maps morphisms to morphisms.

Functors preserve identity and composition. Contravariant functors reverse the direction of morphisms.

=== Natural Transformations

A natural transformation is a morphism between functors. It assigns to each object in the source category a morphism in the target category, satisfying a commutativity condition.

Two functors are naturally isomorphic if there's a natural transformation between them that is an isomorphism at each object.

=== Categories in Practice

Examples of categories include:

Top: Topological spaces and continuous maps.

Vect: Vector spaces and linear transformations.

Group: Groups and group homomorphisms.

Each can be represented as a directed graph (nodes as objects, arrows as morphisms), forming a common structure.

=== Universal Constructions, Limits, and Colimits

Many constructions across mathematics are captured categorically via universal properties. These include:

Limits: Generalizations of products and intersections.

Colimits: Generalizations of unions and quotients.

These allow the definition of objects purely by their relationships within a category.

=== Equivalence of Categories

Two categories are equivalent if there's a pair of functors (one in each direction) that are inverses up to natural isomorphism. This captures the idea of structural sameness without requiring isomorphism of objects.

=== Higher-Dimensional Categories

Category theory generalizes to n-categories, allowing morphisms between morphisms, and so on.

2-categories: Include natural transformations between functors.

Bicategories: Loosen strict associativity.

n-categories and ω-categories: Further generalizations used in higher-dimensional algebra.

=== Summary

Category theory provides a universal language to describe and analyze mathematical structures. Through categories, functors, and natural transformations, it unifies diverse areas of mathematics and informs modern developments in logic, algebra, topology, and computer science.



== Theory of Computation
=== Introduction
The theory of computation is a branch of theoretical computer science and mathematics that explores what problems can be solved using algorithms on computational models and how efficiently these problems can be solved. It is structured into three primary branches:

Automata theory and formal languages

Computability theory

Computational complexity theory

==== Models of Computation
To study computation rigorously, theoretical models such as the Turing machine are used. The Turing machine is central to the Church–Turing thesis, which posits it as the most powerful reasonable model of computation. Other notable models include:

Lambda calculus

Combinatory logic

μ-recursive functions

Markov algorithms

Register machines

==== Automata Theory
Automata theory deals with abstract machines and the problems they can solve. Key types of automata, corresponding to classes of languages in the Chomsky hierarchy, include:

Type-0 (Recursively enumerable): Turing machines

Type-1 (Context-sensitive): Linear-bounded automata

Type-2 (Context-free): Pushdown automata

Type-3 (Regular): Finite automata

Automata are closely tied to formal languages, serving as models to generate or recognize them.

==== Formal Language Theory
Formal languages are defined over alphabets using a set of rules. They are classified in the Chomsky hierarchy and recognized by different types of automata. This theory provides a foundational framework for specifying problems to be solved computationally.

==== Computability Theory
This branch studies the limits of algorithmic problem-solving. It addresses what problems are solvable in principle:

The Halting Problem: A central result proving some problems are unsolvable by any Turing machine.

Rice's Theorem: Any non-trivial property of the function computed by a Turing machine is undecidable.

Related to recursion theory, which generalizes Turing-computability.

==== Computational Complexity Theory
This field examines the efficiency of algorithms. Major concepts include:

Time and space complexity

Big O notation

Complexity classes like P and NP

The P vs NP problem: One of the Millennium Prize Problems

Complexity theory categorizes problems based on the resources required for their solution.

==== Summary
The theory of computation provides a formal basis for understanding what can be computed and how efficiently. It blends logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science to explore the capabilities and limitations of computational models and algorithms.



== Gödel's incompleteness theorem & Axiom sets
=== Introduction

Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem is one of the most profound discoveries in mathematics. It reveals that in any consistent axiomatic system capable of expressing arithmetic, there exist true statements that are unprovable within that system. This challenges the very notion of mathematical certainty.

=== From Paradox to Proof

Consider the classic paradox: “This statement is false.” If true, then it’s false; if false, then it’s true. Such self-referential statements create logical loops.

Kurt Gödel translated this idea into mathematics. By encoding statements as numbers, he constructed a mathematical version: “This statement cannot be proved.” Unlike linguistic paradoxes, mathematical statements must be either true or false.

=== Gödel’s Strategy: Gödel Numbering

Gödel devised a method to assign unique code numbers to mathematical statements and proofs:

Every statement (e.g., axioms, theorems) is represented by a number.

Proof becomes a mathematical property (e.g., divisibility by axiom codes).

This allows mathematics to refer to itself.

=== The Unprovable Truth

Gödel’s key construction:

“This statement cannot be proved from the axioms.”

Analyzing this:

If false → it’s provable → contradiction → must be true.

Therefore, it's a true but unprovable statement within the system.

=== Implications of the Theorem

Incompleteness: Not all truths are provable.

Consistency limits: A system cannot prove its own consistency.

Infinite regress: Adding unprovable truths as axioms generates new unprovable truths.

=== Philosophical and Historical Context

Mathematicians once believed every truth could be proved. Gödel’s theorem upended this view, revealing fundamental limits.

Gödel worked at Princeton alongside Einstein, who deeply respected his intellect. His theorems, published in 1931, marked a revolution in logic.

=== Formal Systems and Axioms

Mathematics is based on formal systems:

Axioms: Assumed truths (e.g., "through any two points there is a unique line").

Rules of inference: Logical methods for deriving new truths.

Theorems: Statements derived from axioms via inference.

Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry demonstrate how changing axioms can lead to different, yet consistent, mathematical systems.

=== Gödel’s First and Second Incompleteness Theorems

First Theorem: In any consistent, sufficiently expressive system (e.g., number theory), there are true statements that cannot be proved within that system.

Second Theorem: No such system can prove its own consistency.

These results showed that mathematics cannot be reduced to a complete algorithmic procedure.

=== Impact on Computation and Logic

Alan Turing, working concurrently, proved the Halting Problem is unsolvable—reinforcing Gödel’s insights. These ideas founded modern computer science and formalized the limitations of algorithmic reasoning.

=== Beyond Gödel: Emergence and Perception

Questions remain about emergence and perception in systems like cellular automata and neural networks:

Simple rules can generate complex behavior (e.g., Game of Life).

Ambiguous perception (e.g., rabbit-duck illusion) reflects subjective interpretation.

Complementarity (from quantum mechanics) explains how different perspectives can coexist.

=== Goldbach, Riemann, and Real-World Conjectures

Initially thought to affect only abstract logic, Gödel’s theorem also impacts number theory.

Goldbach’s Conjecture: May be true yet unprovable.

Riemann Hypothesis: If undecidable, must be true (since its falsehood would be provable).

=== Mathematics as an Open-Ended Process

Gödel’s work invites us to view mathematics not as a closed system, but an evolving, creative enterprise. Just as physics evolved from Newton to Einstein, our understanding of computation and proof may shift with future insights.

=== Subjectivity and Limits of Knowledge

Human perception, biases, and unconscious influences affect even formal reasoning:

AI training includes implicit human biases.

Conscious awareness does not fully capture all cognitive processes.

=== Summary

Gödel’s theorems reveal a gap between truth and proof.

No consistent, complete system can prove all mathematical truths.

Formal systems are limited by their own structure.

Mathematics, like reality, may remain partly unknowable.

Gödel’s legacy reshaped logic, mathematics, and computer science—reminding us that even in structured thought, mystery remains.
