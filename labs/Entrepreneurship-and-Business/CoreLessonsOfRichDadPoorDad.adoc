= Core Lessons from *Rich Dad Poor Dad*

== 1. The Rich Don’t Work for Money

*Meaning*:
Instead of working for money (trading time for a paycheck), the rich build or acquire assets that generate passive income.

*What Happens in the Book*:
Robert and Mike work for Rich Dad for free. They learn that working hard at a job doesn’t make you wealthy; it keeps you dependent.

*Real-Life Applications*:
- Create passive income streams through rental properties, dividends, or royalties.
- Invest in businesses or assets that continue earning money without your daily involvement.

*Example*:
Buying vending machines, placing them in high-traffic areas, and collecting profits.

== 2. Financial Literacy is Key

*Meaning*:
You must understand how money works—know the difference between assets and liabilities.

*What Happens in the Book*:
Rich Dad teaches Robert and Mike that assets put money in your pocket, while liabilities take money out. Many people confuse the two.

*Real-Life Applications*:
- Buy income-generating assets: stocks, bonds, rental properties.
- Track your income, expenses, assets, and liabilities using a simple balance sheet.

*Example*:
Purchasing dividend-paying stocks that send you regular income, instead of buying a brand-new car (a liability).

== 3. Mind Your Own Business

*Meaning*:
Focus on building your own assets, even if you have a job.

*What Happens in the Book*:
Robert keeps his day job but builds his asset column on the side. Ray Kroc (McDonald’s) wasn’t in the burger business; he was in the real estate business.

*Real-Life Applications*:
- Start a side business or build a portfolio of investments.
- Build intellectual property (write a book, create digital products).

*Example*:
Creating an online course on a skill you know and selling it on platforms like Udemy.

== 4. The Power of Corporations & Tax Laws

*Meaning*:
The rich use corporations to protect and grow their wealth, gaining tax advantages.

*What Happens in the Book*:
Rich Dad teaches how corporations pay expenses before taxes, while employees pay taxes before expenses.

*Real-Life Applications*:
- Start an LLC or corporation to legally deduct business expenses (home office, car, travel).
- Understand how to use tax laws to your advantage.

*Example*:
Running an online business through an LLC and deducting expenses like internet, phone, and education.

== 5. The Rich Invent Money

*Meaning*:
With financial intelligence, you can create opportunities to build wealth that others can’t see.

*What Happens in the Book*:
Robert and Mike open a comic book library and earn money without working there.

*Real-Life Applications*:
- Spot undervalued assets (real estate, stocks) and buy low, sell high.
- Create products or services based on market demand.

*Example*:
Flipping furniture by buying cheap pieces, restoring them, and selling at a profit.

== 6. Work to Learn, Not to Earn

*Meaning*:
Focus on acquiring skills that will help you build wealth rather than just working for a paycheck.

*What Happens in the Book*:
Robert works different jobs to learn sales, marketing, and management.

*Real-Life Applications*:
- Take jobs that build sales, marketing, or leadership skills.
- Learn about investing, accounting, and business management.

*Example*:
Working part-time at a sales job to get comfortable with closing deals, then using those skills to sell your own product.

== 7. Overcoming Obstacles

*Meaning*:
Fear, laziness, bad habits, cynicism, and arrogance prevent most people from achieving financial freedom.

*What Happens in the Book*:
Rich Dad explains how fear keeps people stuck in the rat race, and how greed, bad habits, and cynicism trap them.

*Real-Life Applications*:
- Build the habit of investing a percentage of income monthly.

Automating $50 a month into an index fund, even when it feels scary or unfamiliar.
