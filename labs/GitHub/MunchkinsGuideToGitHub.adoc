*_This is a comprehensive TLDR guide to {git-docs}[Git] and {github-docs}[GitHub] by Captain Lugaru._*

== What is git and GitHub?

=== What is Git?

Git is a _**distributed** version (*revision*) control **system** (VCS)_ designed to track changes in files, usually code.
It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project while maintaining a detailed history of all changes.
Key features of git:

- *Version Control*: Tracks every change in a project, allowing you to revert to earlier versions.
- *Branching* and *Merging*: Create separate branches for different tasks (e.g., new features, bug fixes) and merge them back into the main branch.
- *_Distributed System_*: _Every developer has a *complete copy* of the project, including the history._
- *Efficiency*: Git handles large projects efficiently and is widely used in software development.

==== Why Use Git?

It:

. Prevents code conflicts by allowing developers to work on separate branches.
. Enables collaboration across teams, even remotely.
. Keeps a history of all changes, making it easier to debug or audit the code.
. Provides a simple way to revert to previous versions of code; cherrypick, stash, squash, rebase, etc.
. ... is so cool!

==== Common Use Cases:

- Software development.
- Writing technical documentation.
- Managing infrastructure as code.


=== Now, What is GitHub?

GitHub is a _platform_ built on top of Git that provides _hosting_ for repositories,
collaboration tools, and additional features to manage software development projects.

==== Key Features of GitHub:

- Repository Hosting: Store and manage Git repositories in the cloud; to have a shared central copy as a system of record (SoR).
- Collaboration: Tools for _code reviews_, _discussions_, wikis, blogs, and managing _issues_.
- *Community*: A hub for open-source, shared-source and private group projects; and, contributors (all types) networking.
- Automation: Automate tasks with {github-actions-docs}[GitHub Actions] (e.g., testing, deployment).
- Documentation: Built-in support for {github-wikis}[wikis] and scene-civilized repository {kai-root-files}[root layout files] (example by {kai-author}),
such as the {github-readmes}[active README] files; and even automatic blogging with {github-pages}[GitHub Pages].

==== Why use GitHub?

- Portfolio: Showcase your work and contributions. (a todo for yours truly)
- Collaboration: Work with other developers remotely.
- Learning: Contribute to open-source projects and learn from others’ code.


==== Key Benefits for Teams:

- Centralized codebase for all team members.
- Tools for tracking tasks, issues, and progress.
- Automated workflows to streamline testing and deployment.

=== Git vs GitHub:

Git is a revision control system that runs locally on your computer;
or remotely on a server; or as a backing service -- present in every Git repository.
It requires a manual setup for collaboration.
Open source software freely available to use and modify, but not as a service.

GitHub is a hosting platform built ontop of Git.
It uses Git as a backing service for version control.
It is accessible through the internet and provides collaboration tools.
It is a proprietary platform with free and paid tiers.


== Key Terminology:

- Repository (Repo): A folder that stores your project’s files and history; physically a `.git/` folder.
- Working Copy: A reduced projection of all commits on all files in the repository; usually a sibling to the hidden `.git/` folder.
- Commit: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.
- Branch: A separate version of the repository for independent work.
- Merge: Integrating changes from one branch into another.
- Pull Request (PR): A request to merge changes from one branch to another, often used for code reviews.
- Fork: A personal copy of another person’s repository.
- Clone: A local copy of a repository.
- Issue: A way to track bugs, feature requests, or tasks.
- Remote: The cloud-based version of your repository (hosted on GitHub); or another teammate repository in their `.git` folder.
- HEAD: The pointer to the current commit in your working directory.


== Setting up Git and GitHub:

=== Local Git instance:

In the simplest way::
- Download Git for your operating system from Git-SCM.
- Install Git following the setup instructions for your OS.

More common way::
- Install git using a package manager, such as Homebrew or Apt.
- Configure local user Git instance for one or more SoRs.

Next, Configure git::
[source,sh]
----
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
----

Verify Configuration::
[source,sh]
----
git config --list
----

=== Create a GitHub Account:

Sign up at GitHub by going to https://github.com.
Verify your email address to complete registration.


==== Step 1: Setting up your first Repository.

- Log in to your GitHub account.
- Click Repositories > New.
- Fill in the repository name and description.
- Choose Public or Private visibility.
- Initialize with a README (optional).

==== Step 2: Clone the repository to your local machine, and `push` a change:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`

Add and commit a change::
- `cd your-repo-name`
- Create or Modify Files
- Stage changes: `git add .`
- commit the changes: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
- push changes to GitHub: `git push`

Observe your change on GitHub repository welcome page.
I recommend changing the contents of the README or README.md file.
Also, my preferred markup is AsciiDoc, i.e., README.adoc; now fully supported.


=== The GitHub Interface

Overview of GitHub Dashboard::
- Repositories: View and manage all your repositories.
- Pull Requests: Monitor and manage PRs for collaboration.
- Issues: Track and manage bugs or feature requests.
- Explore: Discover trending projects or topics.
- Settings: Configure profile, repositories, and account settings.

Understanding the Repository Page::
- Code: View and manage files in the repository.
- Issues: Log and manage issues for the project.
- Pull Requests: Collaborate on changes.
- Actions: Set up and view automated workflows.
- Insights: Analyze repository activity and contributions.

_I recommend finding all of these elements by yourself -- it is fun._

== Acceptance

- [x] Graded assignment https://github.com/rdd13r[by `rdd13r`] on March 7th 2025.
- [x] Final grade is 100%. (A+) at Mimir Academy.
