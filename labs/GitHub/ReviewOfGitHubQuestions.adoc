= Branching Strategies and Development Workflows Cheat Sheet

== 1. How to Separate Classes to Stories/Issues

=== ➤ Background
A *Story* (or *Issue*) describes a user need, feature, or bug.
A *Class* in code is a unit of implementation (object-oriented design).

=== ➤ How to Break Classes into Issues
1. **Start with the User Story / Requirement**
Example:
[source,txt]
----
"As a user, I want to register an account."
----

2. **Break It Down Into Technical Tasks**
* Backend: Implement `User` class.
* API: Create `RegisterUserController`.
* Frontend: Build the registration form.

3. **Create Issues per Responsibility**

[cols="2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Issue | Code Artifact
| Create User model + validation | `User` class (Model)
| Implement registration business logic | `UserService` class
| Expose registration endpoint | `UserController` class
|===

=== ➤ Map Class Responsibilities to Issues
* Each Issue tackles one behavior/responsibility, not necessarily just a single class.
* Focus on outcomes, not objects. Think *features*, not files.

== 2. How to Map Issues to Branches

=== ➤ Workflow
* Each Issue typically corresponds to one branch (sometimes more for big tasks).

=== ➤ Naming Convention Example
[cols="2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Item | Example
| Issue | #42 Add Login Form
| Branch Name | feature/login-form-42
|===

=== ➤ Steps
1. Create an Issue:
[source,txt]
----
Add Login Form (#42)
----
2. Create a Branch for the Issue:
[source,bash]
----
git checkout -b feature/login-form-42
----
3. Work, Commit, and Reference the Issue in commit messages:
[source,bash]
----
git commit -m "Add login controller (#42)"
----
4. Push the Branch:
[source,bash]
----
git push origin feature/login-form-42
----

== 3. What is Trunk-Based Development (TBD)?

=== ➤ Definition
* A branching model where developers:
** Work in short-lived branches (or directly on the mainline, i.e., `main` or `trunk`).
** Merge back to the mainline frequently—often multiple times per day.

=== ➤ Key Practices
* Small, incremental changes
* Continuous integration
* Feature flags (for incomplete features)
* Fewer branches, no long-lived branches

=== ➤ Why Use TBD?
✅ Faster delivery
✅ Avoid merge hell
✅ Encourage continuous integration and testing
✅ Simplify releases
✅ Works well with CI/CD pipelines

== 4. Why Feature Branches Are Short-Lived

=== ➤ Definition
A *Feature Branch* is a branch used to develop a specific feature or fix.

=== ➤ Why Keep Them Short-Lived?
* **Reduce Merge Conflicts**:
Long-lived branches drift from `main`, making merges painful.
* **Encourage Continuous Integration**:
Short branches integrate changes early and often.
* **Increase Code Review Speed**:
Smaller pull requests are easier to review.
* **Accelerate Feedback**:
Smaller changes are easier to test and validate.

=== ➤ Ideal Lifetime
✅ Hours to a few days
❌ Weeks or months ➜ leads to merge hell!

== 5. What is a Pull Request (PR)?

=== ➤ Definition
A *Pull Request (PR)* is a formal request to merge code from one branch (usually a feature branch) into another branch (usually `main`).

=== ➤ What Happens in a PR?
1. Push a branch to GitHub.
2. Create a Pull Request:
* Describe what you did.
* Link related Issues.
3. Reviewers check:
* Code quality
* Test coverage
* Functionality
4. Merge when approved.

=== ➤ PR Workflow Example
1. Create branch:
[source,bash]
----
git checkout -b feature/signup-page
----
2. Push and open PR:
* From `feature/signup-page` ➡️ to `main`
* PR triggers:
** Code review
** CI tests
3. Merge when approved.

== 6. What is a Forever Branch?

=== ➤ Definition
A *Forever Branch* is:
* A long-lived branch that persists indefinitely.
* Examples: `main`, `develop`

=== ➤ Types
[cols="2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Type | Purpose
| main | Stable code; always production-ready
| develop | (Used in Git Flow): Ongoing dev work
|===

=== ➤ Forever Branch vs Feature Branch
[cols="3,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Branch Type | Lifetime | Usage
| Forever | Permanent | `main`, `develop`
| Feature | Short-lived | `feature/login-page`, `bugfix/api-crash`
|===

== 7. Why Do All This? (Branching Strategies, Short-Lived Feature Branches, PRs, etc.)

=== ➤ 7.1 Why Branch?
* Isolation: Work on features without breaking others.
* Parallel development.
* Safer experimentation.

=== ➤ 7.2 Why Short-Lived Feature Branches?
* Reduces merge conflicts.
* Enables faster feedback.
* Encourages Continuous Integration (CI).
* Easier reviews and smaller pull requests.

=== ➤ 7.3 Why Pull Requests?
* Code quality: Peer review.
* Catch bugs earlier.
* Improve collaboration.
* Enforce CI pipelines before merge.

=== ➤ 7.4 Why Trunk-Based Development or Forever Branches?
* Simplifies release management.
* Always have stable, deployable code on `main`.
* Keeps teams in sync with shared history.

== ✅ Quick Summary

[cols="2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Question | Quick Answer
| Separate classes to issues | Map user stories ➡️ tasks ➡️ classes/components per issue.
| Map issues to branches | Create a branch per issue; use naming conventions like `feature/login-42`.
| Trunk-Based Development | Commit small, fast, frequent changes to `main`, no long-lived feature branches.
| Why feature branches are short-lived | Reduce merge conflicts, speed up reviews, support CI/CD, improve delivery speed.
| What is a Pull Request? | A proposal to merge code; includes review, testing, and approval.
| What is a Forever Branch? | Permanent branches (`main`, `develop`) that always exist and are stable.
| Why do this? | Improve quality, reduce risk, speed up releases, and maintain stable codebases.
