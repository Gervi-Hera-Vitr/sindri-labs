= Git and GitHub
== Chapter 1: Introduction to Git and GitHub (Fully In-Depth)

This chapter explains what Git and GitHub are, why they're important, and how they work together. We’ll cover the theory and the practical knowledge you need before diving into hands-on work.

== 1.1 What Is Git?

=== ➤ Definition
Git is a *Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)* that tracks changes to files and coordinates work on those files among multiple people.

Originally developed by *Linus Torvalds* (creator of Linux) in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel.

=== ➤ Why Use Git?
* Tracks the entire history of your code.
* Supports multiple people working on a project simultaneously.
* Enables you to undo mistakes, experiment safely, and collaborate without overwriting each other’s work.

== 1.2 How Does Git Work?

=== ➤ Git Snapshots, Not Diffs
* Traditional version control systems (like SVN) store differences (diffs) between file versions.
* Git stores *snapshots* of the entire file system every time you commit. If a file hasn’t changed, Git links to the previous file already stored.

=== ➤ The Three Git Areas
* *Working Directory*: Where you modify files on your computer.
* *Staging Area (Index)*: Where you prepare snapshots before committing.
* *Repository (Local)*: Where Git stores committed snapshots permanently.

=== ➤ The Distributed Aspect
Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, not just a working copy.

== 1.3 Core Concepts of Git

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Concept | Description
| Repository (Repo) | A project folder tracked by Git. Local or remote.
| Commit | A saved snapshot of staged files with a message describing changes.
| Branch | A parallel version of the repository, isolated for work like new features.
| Merge | Combining different branches back into one.
| Clone | Downloading a Git repository from another server (e.g., GitHub).
| Push | Sending your commits to a remote repository.
| Pull | Fetching and integrating changes from a remote repository.
| Fetch | Downloading commits from a remote repo but not integrating them.
| HEAD | Pointer to your current branch reference, typically the latest commit.
|===

== 1.4 What Is GitHub?

=== ➤ Definition
GitHub is a *web-based platform* built on Git. It provides remote hosting for Git repositories and collaboration tools that make teamwork easier.

=== ➤ What GitHub Provides
* Cloud Hosting for Git repositories (public & private)
* Collaborative Tools: Pull Requests, Code Review, Issues, Wiki, and more
* Project Management: Milestones, Kanban boards (Projects)
* CI/CD Pipelines with GitHub Actions
* Community & Open Source: Massive open-source community and projects

== 1.5 The Difference Between Git and GitHub

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Git | GitHub
| Version control tool installed locally | Cloud platform hosting Git repositories
| Command-line tool (CLI) | Web interface + API + CLI tools
| Runs locally on your machine | Requires Internet to interact with remote repos
| No built-in collaboration | Collaboration tools: PRs, Issues, Reviews
| Distributed version control | Centralized cloud hosting for distributed Git repos
|===

== 1.6 Why Use Git and GitHub?

=== ➤ For Developers
* Track changes and manage code history
* Experiment without fear (branching and merging)
* Collaborate easily with Pull Requests and code reviews
* Automate testing and deployment with CI/CD

=== ➤ For Teams
* Collaboration: Teams can work on different features simultaneously
* Central Repository: All team members push to and pull from the same remote repo
* Code Reviews: Review code before merging
* Security & Permissions: Control who can access and modify what

=== ➤ For Open Source Contributors
* Fork, clone, contribute via Pull Requests
* Get noticed by participating in popular open-source projects

=== ➤ For Learning and Career
* Public GitHub profiles showcase your skills to employers
* Host your portfolio, projects, and personal websites via GitHub Pages

== 1.7 The GitHub Workflow (How GitHub Works with Git)

=== ➤ Typical Workflow
1. Clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine
2. Create a branch to make changes without disrupting the main branch
3. Make changes and commit them locally
4. Push your branch back to GitHub
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) for your branch
6. Review, discuss, and merge the PR into the main branch
7. Everyone on the team pulls the updated branch to stay in sync

== 1.8 Key Terminology (Must Know Terms)

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Term | Description
| Repository | A folder that contains your project, including all of its history and metadata.
| Branch | A separate line of development in a repo.
| Commit | A snapshot of your staged changes with a message explaining what changed.
| Clone | Making a local copy of a remote GitHub repository.
| Fork | A personal copy of someone else’s repo that you can modify without affecting the original.
| Pull Request | A request to merge your changes from a branch/fork into another branch/repo.
| Merge Conflict | Happens when Git can't automatically merge changes. Requires manual resolution.
| Remote | A version of your project that is hosted on the internet or another network (GitHub).
| Origin | The default name Git gives to the remote repository you clone from.
| HEAD | Points to the current branch you're working on.

| Upstream Repo | The original repository from which you forked.
| Branch Protection | GitHub rules to prevent unauthorized changes to specific branches.
| Reviewer | A person assigned to give feedback or approval on a Pull Request.
|===

== 5.1 Collaboration Approaches on GitHub

=== ➤ Method 1: Collaborators
* Direct contributors added to a private or public repo.
* Can push directly (or via Pull Request).

=== ➤ Method 2: Forks and Pull Requests (Open Source Standard)
* You fork the repo → make changes → open a Pull Request.
* Maintainers review and merge PRs from forks.

== 5.2 Issues: The Collaboration Starting Point

=== ➤ What Are Issues?
* Track bugs, feature requests, tasks, discussions.

=== ➤ Creating an Issue
1. Go to the *Issues* tab.
2. Click *New Issue*.
3. Fill in:
* Title
* Description (Markdown supported)
4. Add:
* Assignees
* Labels
* Milestones

=== ➤ Linking Issues to Commits
Automatically close issues when merging Pull Requests or making commits:
[source,markdown]
----
Fixes #42
Closes #42
Resolves #42
----

== 5.3 Branching for Collaboration

=== ➤ Why Branch?
* Keeps features separate from the main (production) branch.
* Multiple people can work on different features simultaneously.

=== ➤ Branch Naming Conventions
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Type | Example
| Feature | feature/login-form
| Bugfix | bugfix/missing-btn
| Hotfix | hotfix/crash-on-start
|===

== 5.4 Pull Requests (PRs): The Core of Collaboration

=== ➤ What Is a Pull Request?
A Pull Request (PR) is a proposal to merge one branch into another.

PRs allow you to:
* Get feedback
* Perform code reviews
* Run automated tests (CI/CD)
* Collaborate on changes before merging

=== ➤ Creating a Pull Request (Step-by-Step)
1. Push your branch to GitHub.
[source,bash]
----
git push origin feature/login-form
----
2. On GitHub:
* Go to the repo → *Pull Requests* → *New Pull Request*.
* Choose the base branch (typically `main`) and compare it with your feature branch.
* Add:
** Title
** Description (what you did, why, screenshots, link to issues)
* Request Reviewers.
* Submit the PR.

=== ➤ Pull Request Anatomy
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Section | Description
| Title | Short description of the change.
| Description | Detailed explanation. Link issues if needed.
| Files Changed | List of changed files + code diffs.
| Reviewers | People asked to review the PR.
| Assignees | Developers responsible for PR.
| Labels | Context labels like bug, enhancement, WIP.
| Milestones | Group PR into a milestone for a release goal.
|===

== 5.5 Code Review Process (Best Practices)

=== ➤ Reviewers Can:
* Comment on lines of code.
* Request Changes (blocks merging until addressed).
* Approve the PR (merging allowed if branch protection permits).

=== ➤ Best Practices for Code Reviews
* Keep Pull Requests small and focused.
* Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions.
* Use checklists (e.g., code follows standards, tests written).
* Respond to feedback promptly.
* Be respectful and constructive in feedback.

== 5.6 Merging a Pull Request

=== ➤ Merge Options (On GitHub)
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Option | What It Does
| Create Merge Commit | Keeps the entire branch history; adds a merge commit.
| Squash and Merge | Combines all commits into one; simplifies history.
| Rebase and Merge | Rewrites commits onto the base branch for a linear history.
|===

=== ➤ Merge a PR (Manually from CLI)
[source,bash]
----
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature-branch
git push origin main
----

== 5.7 Resolving Merge Conflicts in Pull Requests

=== ➤ When Do Conflicts Happen?
* Two branches modified the same file/line.
* One branch deletes a file the other modifies.

=== ➤ How to Resolve Conflicts
1. GitHub alerts you that the branch has conflicts.
2. Locally:
[source,bash]
----
git fetch origin
git checkout feature-branch
git merge main
----
3. Resolve conflicts in the files:
[source]
----
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is code from main.
=======
This is code from feature-branch.
>>>>>>> feature-branch
----
4. Stage the changes:
[source,bash]
----
git add conflicted-file.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
----
5. Push:
[source,bash]
----
git push origin feature-branch
----

== 5.8 Forking a Repository and Contributing

=== ➤ What Is Forking?
* Forking creates a copy of another repository under your GitHub account.

=== ➤ Why Fork?
* Contribute to open-source projects.
* You don’t need permission to fork.
* Safe place to experiment.

=== ➤ Forking Workflow
1. Click *Fork* on the project’s GitHub page.
2. Clone your fork locally:
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project.git
----
3. Add the original repo as an upstream remote:
[source,bash]
----
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/project.git
----
4. Sync with upstream changes:
[source,bash]
----
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
