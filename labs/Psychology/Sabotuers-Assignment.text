What are Saboteurs?
Saboteurs are the voices in your head that generate negative emotions as you handle life’s everyday challenges.
They represent the automatic patterns in your mind for how to think, feel, and respond.
Your Saboteurs cause all of your stress, anxiety, self-doubt, frustration, restlessness, and unhappiness.
They sabotage your performance, well-being, and relationships.

Now lets meet the Judge, He is your master Saboteur.
The Judge is the universal Saboteur that afflicts everyone.
It is the one that beats you up repeatedly over mistakes or shortcomings,
warns you obsessively about future risks,
wakes you up in the middle of the night worrying,
gets you fixated on what is wrong with others or your life,
etc. Your Judge activates your other Saboteurs,
causes much of your stress and unhappiness,
reduces your effectiveness, and harms your relationships.
The Judge works with one or more Accomplice Saboteurs to hijack your mind and cause most of your setbacks.

The Origin of saboteurs:
Saboteurs start off as our guardians to help us survive the real
and imagined threats to our physical and emotional survival as children.
By the time we are adults,
we no longer need them,
but they have become invisible inhabitants of our mind.

Our Saboteurs’ patterns of thinking,
feeling, and reacting become soft-coded in our brain through neural pathways.
When these neural pathways are triggered,
we are “hijacked” by our Saboteurs and instantly feel,
think, and act using their patterns.

You May think your Saboteurs are good for you,
Your Saboteurs claim they are good for you.
For example, your Judge tells you that constantly badgering you over your mistakes
 and shortcomings causes you to improve and achieve.

And pain can be good for you.
If you put your hand on a hot stove,
it is good to feel pain so you take corrective action.

But negative emotions, like pain,
are only helpful for a quick second to alert you.
If you stay stressed, frustrated, or unhappy,
you will be tunnel-visioned and not capable of finding the best solution to problems,
which your positive brain can do.

So if you’re in negative emotion for more than one second,
your Saboteurs are holding your hand on the hot stove and complaining that life is hard.

Now here is a chart of all of the Saboteurs:
Avoider: Focuses excessively on the positive and pleasant aspects,
avoiding difficult tasks and conflicts.

Controller: Has an anxiety-driven need to take charge and control situations and people's actions,
leading to high stress when control isn't possible.

Hyper-Achiever: Depends on constant performance and achievement for self-respect and validation,
quickly discounting past successes and seeking the next accomplishment.

Hyper-Rational: Places intense focus on rational processing, including in relationships,
which can come across as uncaring or intellectually arrogant.

Hyper-Vigilant: Experiences continuous anxiety about potential dangers and what could go wrong,
resulting in perpetual vigilance.

Pleaser: Seeks acceptance and affection by helping or flattering others,
often neglecting personal needs and becoming resentful.

Restless: Constantly searches for excitement in the next activity or maintains constant busyness,
rarely finding peace or contentment in the present.

Stickler: Exhibits perfectionism and a need for order and organization taken to extremes,
causing anxiety over making things perfect.

Victim: Displays emotional and temperamental behavior to gain attention and affection,
with an extreme focus on internal, particularly painful, feelings, often exhibiting a martyr complex.

How to Beat these Saboteurs:
1. Identify Your Saboteurs
Self-Awareness: Take the Saboteur Assessment to identify your primary Saboteurs.
Track Their Patterns: Recognize when and how each Saboteur shows up in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

2. Strengthen Your Sage Mindset
The Sage represents the positive, empathetic, and rational part of your mind. Strengthening this mindset helps counteract Saboteurs.
Practice Empathy: Be kind and compassionate toward yourself and others.
Focus on Purpose: Align your actions with long-term values and goals rather than short-term emotional reactions.
Explore Solutions: Use creativity and curiosity to find opportunities in challenges.

3. Practice Mental Fitness
Mental fitness exercises strengthen the neural pathways of your Sage brain and weaken those of your Saboteurs.
PQ Reps (Positive Intelligence Repetitions):
Focus on sensory awareness for a few moments (e.g., rub your fingers together and focus on the sensation).
Practice mindfulness techniques like breathing exercises or grounding techniques to bring yourself to the present moment.
Daily Meditation or Reflection: Take 5–10 minutes daily to quiet your mind and redirect your focus to the present.

4. Challenge Your Saboteurs
Name and Shame: When you notice a Saboteur's voice, label it (e.g., “That’s my Avoider speaking”).
Question Its Logic: Ask, “Is this thought helpful? Is it true?” Expose the irrationality or negativity of the Saboteur’s voice.

5. Build Habits of Resilience
Gratitude Practice: Shift focus from problems to what you appreciate.
Set Small, Attainable Goals: Build confidence by achieving incremental successes.
Cultivate Supportive Relationships: Surround yourself with people who encourage and support your Sage mindset.

6. Be Patient and Persistent
Overcoming Saboteurs is a process, not an instant fix. Progress happens as you:
Practice daily mental fitness.
Continuously redirect your thoughts from Saboteurs to your Sage.
Celebrate small wins along the way.
