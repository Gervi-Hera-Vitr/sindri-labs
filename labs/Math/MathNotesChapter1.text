All of grade 9 math:

Chapter 1: Exponents

Product Rule
Formula: X^a * X^b = X^a+b
Explanation:
If you have two numbers with the same base, multiplying them is the same as keeping the base and adding the exponents.
Example: 5^3 * 5^4 = 5^7

Quotient Rule
X^a/X^b = X^a-b, as long as x does not equal 0d
Explanation:
If you divide two numbers with the same base, you keep the base and subtract the exponents.
Example: 7^5 / 7^2 = 7^3

Power of a Power Rule
Formula: (X^a)^b = X^a*b
Explanation:
If you raise a power to another exponent, multiply the exponents.
example: (3^2)^4 = 3^2*4 = 3^8

Power of a product Rule
Formula: (a * b)^x = a^x * b^x
Explanation: If a product (multiplication) inside parentheses is raised to a power, apply the exponent to each factor separately.
example: (2 * 5)^3 = 2^3 * 5^3 = 8 * 125 = 1000

Power of a Quotient Rule
Formula:(a/b)^x = a^x/b^x, as long as b does not equal 0
Explanation:
If a fraction inside parentheses is raised to a power, apply the exponent to both the numerator and denominator.
example: (4/3)^2 = 4^2/3^2 = 16/9

Zero Exponent Rule
Formula:
X^0 = 1 as long as x does not equal 0
Explanation:
Any nonzero number raised to the power of zero is always 1.
example: 10000^0 = 1

Negative Exponent Rule
Formula: X^-a = 1/x^a, as long as x does not equal 0
Explanation:
A negative exponent means to flip the base to its reciprocal and make the exponent positive.
example: 5^-3 = 1/5^3 = 1/125
1/2^-4 = 2^4 = 16

Exponential growth and decay(real world applications)

formula for exponential growth:
A = P(1 + r)^t

formula for exponential decay:
A = p(1 - r)^t
Example: If a population grows at 5% per year, and starts at 1000, in 3 years:
ùê¥ = 1000(1.05)^3 = 1157.63

Scientific Notation:
Used for very large or small numbers.
Example:
3,200,000 = 3.2 √ó 10^6
0.00042 = 4.2 √ó 10^-4
