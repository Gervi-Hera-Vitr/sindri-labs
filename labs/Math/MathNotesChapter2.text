Chapter 2: Polynomials

Types of Polynomials
Monomial: 1 term (e.g., 2x)
Binomial: 2 terms (e.g.,3𝑥+5

Trinomial: 3 terms (e.g.,4𝑥^2 −3𝑥 + 2)
 −3x+2)
Polynomial: More than 3 terms (e.g.,𝑥^4 + 3𝑥^3 −2𝑥^2 +5𝑥−1)
Degree of a Polynomial: The highest exponent on a variable
Example: 4𝑥^3 + 2𝑥^2 −𝑥
 −x has a degree of 3.

 Operations with Polynomials
 1. Collecting Like Terms
 Like terms have the same variable and exponent.
 Example: 3x^2 + 5x^2 = 8x^2
 But: 3x^2 + 5x does not equal 8x^2

 2. Distributive Property (Expanding Brackets)
 Formula: a(b+c)=ab+ac
 Example: 3(x+4)=3x+12


 3. Multiplying Polynomials
 Binomial × Binomial (FOIL Method)
 (a+b)(c+d) = ac+ad+bc+bd
 Example: (x+3)(x+5)=x^2+5x+3x+15=x^2+8x+15

Binomial × Trinomial
(x+2)(x 2+3x+4) = x^3 + 3x^2  +4x + 2x^2 + 6x +8 = x^3 + 5x^2 + 10x + 8

 4. Factoring Polynomials
 Common Factor: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).
 Example:6x^2 +9x =3x (2x+3)
 Factoring Trinomials: Find two numbers that multiply to the last term and add to the middle coefficient.
 Example:x^2 +7x +12 =(x+3)(x+4)
