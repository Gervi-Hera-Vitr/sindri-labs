= Ninth grade cheat sheet
This doc contains all of my knowledge on 9th grade math so far: +
:doctype: book

= Chapter 1: Exponents

==  Product Rule +
 Formula: X^a * X^b = X^a+b +
 Explanation:
 If you have two numbers with the same base, multiplying them is the same as keeping the base and adding the exponents. +
 Example: 5^3 * 5^4 = 5^7 +

==  Quotient Rule +
 X^a/X^b = X^a-b, as long as x does not equal 0 +
 Explanation:
 If you divide two numbers with the same base, you keep the base and subtract the exponents. +
 Example: 7^5 / 7^2 = 7^3

==  Power of a Power Rule +
 Formula: (X^a)^b = X^a*b +
 Explanation:
 If you raise a power to an other exponent, multiply the exponents. +
 Example: (3^2)^4 = 3^2*4 = 3^8 +

==  Power of a product Rule +
 Formula: (a * b)^x = a^x * b^x +
 Explanation: If a product (multiplication) inside parentheses is raised to a power, apply the exponent to each factor separately. +
 Example: (2 * 5)^3 = 2^3 * 5^3 = 8 * 125 = 1000 +

==  Power of a Quotient Rule +
 Formula:(a/b)^x = a^x/b^x, as long as b does not equal 0 +
 Explanation:
 If a fraction inside parentheses is raised to a power, apply the exponent to both the numerator and denominator. +
 Example: (4/3)^2 = 4^2/3^2 = 16/9 +

==  Zero Exponent Rule +
 Formula: +
 X^0 = 1 as long as x does not equal 0
 Explanation: +
 Any nonzero number raised to the power of zero is always 1.
 Example: 10000^0 = 1 +

==  Negative Exponent Rule +
 Formula: X^-a = 1/x^a, as long as x does not equal 0 +
 Explanation:
 A negative exponent means to flip the base to its reciprocal and make the exponent positive. +
 Example: 5^-3 = 1/5^3 = 1/125 +
 1/2^-4 = 2^4 = 16

==  Exponential growth and decay(real world applications)

 formula for exponential growth: +
 A = P(1 + r)^t +

 formula for exponential decay: +
 A = p(1 - r)^t +
 Example: If a population grows at 5% per year, and starts at 1000, in 3 years: +
 ùê¥ = 1000(1.05)^3 = 1157.63 +

==  Scientific Notation: +
 Used for huge or small numbers. +
 Example:
 3,200,000 = 3.2 √ó 10^6
 0.00042 = 4.2 √ó 10^-4


= Chapter 2: Polynomials

==  Types of Polynomials

 Monomial: 1 term (e.g., 2x)
 Binomial: 2 terms (e.g.,3ùë•+5
 Trinomial: 3 terms (e.g.,4ùë•^2 ‚àí3ùë• + 2) ‚àí3x+2) +
 Polynomial: More than 3 terms (e.g.,ùë•^4 + 3ùë•^3 ‚àí2ùë•^2 +5ùë•‚àí1) +
 Degree of a Polynomial: The highest exponent on a variable +
 Example: 4ùë•^3 + 2ùë•^2 ‚àíùë• has a degree of 3.

== Operations with Polynomials

 Collecting Like Terms
 Like terms have the same variable and exponent.
 Example: 3x^2 + 5x^2 = 8x^2
 But: 3x^2 + 5x does not equal 8x^2

 Distributive Property (Expanding Brackets)
 Formula: a(b+c)=ab+ac
 Example: 3(x+4)=3x+12


==  Multiplying Polynomials

 Binomial √ó Binomial (FOIL Method)
(a+b)(c+d) = ac+ad+bc+bd
 Example: (x+3)(x+5)=x^2+5x+3x+15=x^2+8x+15

 Binomial √ó Trinomial
 (x+2)(x 2+3x+4) = x^3 + 3x^2  +4x + 2x^2 + 6x +8 = x^3 + 5x^2 + 10x + 8

==  Factoring Polynomials

 Common Factor: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).
 Example:6x^2 +9x =3x (2x+3)
 Factoring Trinomials: Find two numbers that multiply to the last term and add to the middle coefficient.
 Example:x^2 +7x +12 =(x+3)(x+4)

= chapter  3. Solving Equations

==  Basic Equations
 Isolate the variable using inverse operations.
 Example:
 ùë•+4 = 7
 x = 7 - 4
 x=3

== Two-Step Equations
 Example: 3x - 5 = 10
 Add 5 to both sides: 3x = 15
 divide by 3: x = 5

==  Equations with Fractions
 Multiply both sides by the denominator to eliminate fractions.
 Example:
 x/3 = 5
 Multiply by 3:
 x=5√ó3=15

== Distributive Property in Equations
 Example:
 2(x‚àí3)=10
 Expand:
 2x‚àí6=10
 Solve:
 2x=16‚áíx=8

== Cross-Multiplication (Proportions)

 If a/b = c/d
 then a * d = b * c
 x/5 = 3/10
 x * 10 = 10x
 5 * 3 = 15
 10x = 15
 x = 1.5

== Solving Equations with Variables on Both Sides

 Example:
 5x+3=2x+9
 Subtract 2x from both sides:
 3x+3=9
 Subtract 3 from both sides:
 3x=6
 Divide by 3:
 x=2

= Chapter 4: Linear Relationships

== Scatter Plots and Correlation

 Scatter Plots: Graphs showing relationships between two variables.
 Independent Variable: Plotted on the x-axis.
 Dependent Variable: Plotted on the y-axis.
 Types of Correlation:
 Positive: As x increases, y increases.
 Negative: As x increases, y decreases.
 None: No clear trend.
 Line of Best Fit: Drawn to represent data trends.
 Interpolation: Estimating within data range.
 Extrapolation: Predicting beyond given data range.


== Distance-Time Graphs

 Slope Represents Speed:
 Steeper slope = faster speed.
 Horizontal line = no movement.
 Downward slope = returning to starting position.
 Curved Graphs:
 Increasing slope = acceleration.
 Decreasing slope = deceleration.

== Slope and Equation of a Line

 Slope Formula: m = y2-y1/x2-x1
 Equation Forms:
 Slope-Intercept Form: y = mx + b
 Point-Slope Form: y = y1 = m(x - x1)
 Standard Form: Ax + By + C = 0
 Direct vs. Partial Variation:
 Direct:y = mx(passes through origin,B = 0).
 Partial:y = mx+b(does not pass through origin).

== Graphing and Converting Between Representations

== From Table to Equation:

 Find slope: m = y2-y1/x2-x1
 Identify y-intercept from table.
 Write equation: y = mx + b

== From Graph to Equation:

 Identify y-intercept and slope from graph.
 Use y = mx + b

== From Equation to Graph:

 Plot y-intercept.
 Use slope to find more points.
 Draw straight line through points.

== Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

 Parallel Lines: Same slope.
 Perpendicular Lines: Negative reciprocal slopes.
 Equation of a Line from a Point and Slope:
 Use y - y1 = m(x - x1), solve for y.

 Horizontal and Vertical Lines
 Horizontal Line: y = c , slope = 0.
 Vertical Line: x = c , slope undefined.
