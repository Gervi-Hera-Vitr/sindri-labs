The Full History of Ukraine

Early Human Presence in Ukraine
The history of Ukraine dates back millions of years to the early presence of hominids in Europe.
The first humanoid creatures appeared in East Africa around 2.5 million years ago
and by 1.2 million years ago, early humans had migrated to Europe, including present-day Ukraine, via the Balkans.
Ukraine has some of the oldest discovered settlements of hominids in Central and Eastern Europe, such as the sites at Coro and Medzh.
Modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) emerged in East Africa around 200,000 years ago and reached Europe approximately 40,000 years ago,
gradually replacing Neanderthals.

Prehistoric Developments in Ukraine
As early humans settled in Ukraine, they developed tools, art, and social structures:
Early Art & Tools: Ornaments, figurines, and tools made from mammoth ivory have been discovered, along with advanced tools like needles and musical instruments.
Religious Beliefs: Burial practices indicate the emergence of spiritual traditions.
Architecture: The construction of mammoth-bone dwellings shows early architectural advancements.

The Ice Age and Its Impact
During the Ice Age (about 1 million years ago), massive glaciers shaped Europe's geography.
Winds from these glaciers helped form Ukraine’s fertile soil, which later became crucial for agriculture.
As the climate changed, mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses became extinct,
while reindeer, buffalo, and horses thrived, providing food and resources for early humans.

The Neolithic Revolution: From Hunting to Farming
Between the 7th and 4th millennia BC, Ukrainian societies transitioned from hunter-gathering to agriculture:
Flint-bladed sickles and slash-and-burn farming methods were introduced.
The invention of pottery improved food storage.
Permanent settlements and villages began to form, allowing population growth.

The Black Sea Flood (5,600 BC)
A significant event in early Ukrainian history was the transformation of the Black Sea.
Around 5,600 BC, the Mediterranean Sea spilled into what was then a freshwater lake, turning it into a salty sea.
This flooding forced human migrations and reshaped the surrounding environment.

By the end of the Stone Age (5th–3rd millennium BC), metal tools (copper and bronze) were introduced,
marking the beginning of more complex social structures.

The Trypillian Culture (6th–3rd Millennium BC)
One of Ukraine’s most significant prehistoric civilizations was the Trypillian culture:
Settlements: Unfortified villages were built on fertile plains, some reaching populations of 20,000—larger than many medieval towns.
Architecture: Houses were often two stories tall, showcasing advanced construction techniques.
Agriculture: Prosperity was largely due to Ukraine’s fertile lands.
The Indo-Europeans and the Domestication of the Horse
Ukraine played a foundational role in the early history of the Indo-European people.
Between the 4th and 2nd millennia BC, Indo-European tribes migrated from Ukraine across Europe, Asia, and even into India.
A key development was the domestication of the horse in Ukraine around the 4th millennium BC.
Horses revolutionized transportation and warfare, giving Indo-Europeans a military and economic advantage.
Ukrainian horses were highly valued, and their influence reached civilizations as far as Egypt.

The Scythians: Warriors of the Steppe (8th Century BC – 4th Century AD)
The Scythians, an Indo-Iranian nomadic tribe, returned to Ukraine in the 8th century BC after traveling through Asia.
They established one of Europe’s earliest organized states with a government, taxation system, and a permanent army.

Scythian Achievements and Influence
Cultural Legacy: The Scythians worshiped the sun and fire, buried their dead with red ochre and weapons, and were known for their rich gold artifacts.
Military Prowess: Their cavalry and mobile fortifications were among the strongest in the ancient world. Even Persian King Darius I failed to conquer them in 513 BC.
Trade and Economy: They controlled vital trade routes and influenced cultures from the Balkans to the Middle East.
The Scythians left a lasting impact on Ukrainian culture, including traditional clothing, phonetic traits in the Ukrainian language, and the famous trident symbol, later adopted by Kyivan Rus’.

The Sarmatians: Successors to the Scythians (4th Century BC – 4th Century AD)
Following the decline of the Scythians, the Sarmatians, another Indo-Iranian tribe, took control of the region. Known for their powerful cavalry, they developed cataphracts, heavily armored horsemen, which influenced medieval knights.
Their warrior culture, including female warriors known as "Amazons,"
left a deep mark on Ukrainian traditions, particularly among the later Cossacks.

The Slavs and the Rise of Kyivan Rus’
By the 1st century AD, Slavic tribes were emerging in Ukraine. Early Greek sources referred to them as the Veneti,
describing them as fierce warriors who practiced guerrilla warfare.
The Slavs eventually divided into groups, including the Antes, who formed a powerful tribal union in Right-Bank Ukraine,
and the Sclaveni, who migrated to the Balkans.

The Founding of Kyiv (5th–6th Century AD)
According to legend, Kyiv was founded by three brothers, Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv,
along with their sister Lybid. By the 9th century, it became a powerful center of trade and governance.

The Viking Influence (9th–10th Century AD)
During the 9th century, Varangians (Vikings) arrived in Eastern Europe.
They played a role in unifying Slavic tribes and establishing the foundations of Kyivan Rus’,
a powerful state that dominated Eastern Europe.

Kyivan Rus’ saw significant expansion under Prince Sviatoslav the Brave (964–972 AD),
who crushed the Khazar Khaganate and extended Rus' influence deep into the Balkans.

The Golden Age of Ukraine: Kyivan Rus’ (10th–11th Century AD)
Volodymyr the Great (980–1015 AD)
Christianization of Ukraine (988 AD): Volodymyr adopted Christianity, strengthening cultural ties with Byzantium.
Military & Governance: He expanded the state, implemented legal reforms, and fortified borders.

Yaroslav the Wise (1018–1054 AD)
Cultural & Religious Growth: Yaroslav built St. Sophia’s Cathedral, developed Kyiv into a major European city, and promoted education.
Legal Reforms: He introduced written laws and established trade and diplomatic alliances with European monarchs.
By the 11th century, Kyiv was the second-largest city in Europe after Constantinople, with a population of around 150,000.

Conclusion: Ukraine’s Lasting Legacy
From prehistoric settlers to the rise of Kyivan Rus’,
Ukraine has been a cradle of civilization.
It played a crucial role in Indo-European migrations,
horse domestication, and the development of one of Europe’s most influential medieval states.

Even as history brought waves of invaders and changing rulers,
Ukraine remained a land of rich culture, fierce warriors, and deep historical significance.
Today, its past continues to shape its national identity and place in the world.
