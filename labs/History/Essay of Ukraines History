The Stone Age and Early Ukraine Settlement:
The first Humanoid creatures appeared in East Africa 2.5 million years ago.
A group, The first Ukrainian's migrated to Europe via the Balkans around 1.2 million years ago.
Ukraine has the oldest discovered settlements of hominids in Central and Eastern Europe (e.g., Coro and Medzh sites).

Ukrainian's Homo Sapiens Arrival:
Modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) emerged in East Africa ~200,000 years ago, reached Europe ~40,000 years ago.
Neanderthals, also present in Europe, were eventually replaced by Homo sapiens.

2.Early Ukrainian's Advancements:
Cultural and Technological Advancements of Ukrainian's:
Early art: Ornaments, figurines, and tools were discovered in Ukrainian sites (e.g., mammoth ivory bracelets, painted tusks).
Religious beliefs appeared, as seen in burial practices.
Advanced tools like needles, musical instruments, and mammoth-bone dwellings were developed.
