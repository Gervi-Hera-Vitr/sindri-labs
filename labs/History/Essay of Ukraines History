1.Early Ukrainian's
The Stone Age and Early Ukraine Settlement:
The first Humanoid creatures appeared in East Africa 2.5 million years ago.
A group, The first Ukrainian's migrated to Europe via the Balkans around 1.2 million years ago.
Ukraine has the oldest discovered settlements of hominids in Central and Eastern Europe (e.g., Coro and Medzh sites).

Ukrainian's Homo Sapiens Arrival:
Modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) emerged in East Africa ~200,000 years ago, reached Europe ~40,000 years ago.
Neanderthals, also present in Europe, were eventually replaced by Homo sapiens.

2.Early Ukrainian's Advancements:
Cultural and Technological Advancements of Ukrainian's:
Early art: Ornaments, figurines, and tools were discovered in Ukrainian sites (e.g., mammoth ivory bracelets, painted tusks).
Religious beliefs appeared, as seen in burial practices.
Advanced tools like needles, musical instruments, and mammoth-bone dwellings were developed.

3. Regional Impacts on Ukrainian's
The Impact of the Ice Age Glaciation and Climate:
The Ice Age (~1 million years ago) created glaciers up to several kilometers thick, shaping Europe’s geography.
Winds from glaciers helped form Ukraine's fertile soil.

Extinction of Megafauna:
Mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses became extinct due to climate changes and scarcity of food.
Reindeer, buffalo, and horses thrived, becoming primary prey for humans.

4. More Ukrainian's Advances:
Transition to Agriculture (Neolithic Revolution) From Hunting to Farming:
Around 7th–4th millennium BC, people in Ukraine adopted agriculture and cattle breeding.
Tools like flint-bladed sickles and slash-and-burn farming methods were introduced.

Cultural Changes:
Pottery invention improved food storage.
More sedentary lifestyles allowed population growth and village formation.

 Political Traditions:
 The succession system in Kievan Rus' followed Scythian customs—leadership passed to the eldest kin rather than from father to son, differing from Western European monarchies.


 6. Archaeological Evidence and Historical Records
 Burial Sites: Large burial mounds (kurgans) discovered near Vasylkiv, Kyiv region, reflect Scythian royal traditions.
 Fortifications: Massive wooden fortresses and ramparts were more resource-intensive than Egypt’s Great Pyramid.
 Written Sources: The Scythians are mentioned in works by Herodotus, Pliny the Elder, and other ancient historians.


Military Glory of Ancient Ukraine


1. The Scythians’ Military Dominance
Fearsome Reputation: Greek historian Thucydides called the Scythians "the strongest not only in Europe but also in Asia."
Persian Invasion (513 BC):
Darius I of Persia led an army of ~700,000 soldiers into Scythia, building bridges over the Bosporus and the Danube.
The Scythians replied with symbolic gifts (bird, frog, mouse, and arrows), meaning:
"Unless you can fly, burrow, or swim, you'll fall to Scythian arrows."
Scorched-earth tactics: The Scythians retreated, burning crops and poisoning wells.
Victory: Despite Persia’s size, Darius fled in defeat. The Scythians pursued the Persians back to the Bosporus, even allying with Sparta.

Traditions like the cult of the sword, wide trousers (sharovary), and pointed hats carried into Ukrainian culture.
The Name "Rus'": Likely linked to the Roxolani, a prominent Sarmatian tribe.
Ukrainian Cossacks: Traced their origins to the Roxolani; “Rox” means “clear” in Sarmatian.


6. Decline and Legacy
Integration: The Sarmatians eventually merged with other tribes, including the Slavs and Germanic peoples.
Historical Roles:
Served as mercenaries for Rome in Britain.
Founded states with Goths in Spain and Vandals in Africa.
Final Strongholds: Some Sarmatian tribes, like the Alans, survived in Ukraine and Crimea until the Mongol invasion (13th century).

Why the Roman Empire Fell (Influence of Events in Ukraine)

1. Roman Expansion Near Ukraine
Annexation of Dacia (2nd Century AD): Rome expanded close to Ukraine’s modern borders.
Julius Caesar's Unfulfilled Campaign: He planned to invade Scythia but was assassinated before executing it.
Ovid’s Exile: The Roman poet described constant Sarmatian attacks and widespread influence of their culture, including traditional wide trousers that influenced Ukrainian attire.


2. Sarmatian and Slavic Pressure on Rome
Trajan’s Wall: Built to defend against Sarmatian and Slavic raids; remnants still exist in Ukraine.
Gothic Invasion (3rd Century AD):
The Goths migrated from Scandinavia to northern Black Sea regions, launching raids into the Roman Empire.
Rome lost control beyond the Danube by the late 3rd century AD.


3. The Fall of the Gothic Kingdom

After executing Sunilda (daughter of a Roxolan prince), her brothers wounded Ermanaric, leading to his death.
Hunnic Invasion (375 AD):
Slavs and Sarmatians allied with the Huns to defeat the Goths.
This triggered the Gothic migration, eventually leading to their role in sacking Rome (410 AD).


4. The Hunnic Empire and Its Impact
Formation (4th–5th Century AD): The Huns, originally from Central Asia, conquered territories in Ukraine, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova.
Language Influence: Huns spoke a form of “Scythian,” with words like "med" (honey) and "strava" (dish) still present in Ukrainian today.


5. Attila the Hun’s Legacy (444–453 AD)
Expansion: Conquered Greek cities along the Black Sea, achieving what Scythians never fully managed.
Tribute from Rome: The Roman Empire paid the Huns 687 kg of gold annually to prevent invasions.
Symbolic Sword: A Scythian sword found by a shepherd was gifted to Attila, seen as a sign of divine support for his conquests.


6. Major Battles and Attila’s Dominance

Fought between the Huns and a coalition of Romans and Visigoths.
Ended in a stalemate but weakened both sides.
Attila’s Influence:
Met with the Pope to negotiate peace.
Belittled Roman emperors, claiming they were equals only to his generals.


7. The Decline of the Hunnic Empire
After Attila’s Death:
His sons fought over the empire, leading to fragmentation.
The empire collapsed due to internal conflicts and loss of conquered territories.


8. How These Events Led to Rome’s Fall
Barbarian Migrations: Triggered by Hunnic invasions in Ukraine, pushing tribes like the Goths into Roman lands.
Military Pressure: Continuous attacks from Sarmatians, Slavs, Goths, and Huns weakened Rome’s borders.
Sack of Rome (410 AD): Marked a major turning point, leading to the decline of the Western Roman Empire.

Cultural and Historical Legacy
Gothic Influence: Some Goths settled in Crimea, creating the Principality of Theodoro, lasting until 1475.
Sarmatian Contributions: Influenced the Ukrainian national costume, language, and military traditions.

Military Skills: Known for guerrilla warfare tactics, such as:
Fighting in dense forests.
Hiding underwater while breathing through reeds.
Capturing enemy informants.


2. The Slavic Homeland and Expansion
Origins: Homeland likely in the Northern Carpathians, Volhynia, Polisia, and along the right bank of the Dnipro.
Language Clues: River names in Ukraine (e.g., Dnipro, Dniester, Danube) have Indo-Iranian (Sarmatian) origins, while many others have Slavic roots.
Early Settlements: Slavs lived along the Lower Dniester and near the Black Sea by the 3rd century AD.


3. The Division of the Slavs
Antes and Sclaveni (4th–7th Century AD):
Antes: A powerful tribal union of Slavs and Sarmatians (mainly Roxolani), inhabiting Right-Bank Ukraine and the northern Black Sea coast.
Called "the most powerful of all Slavs" by Greek sources.
Sclaveni: Lived between modern-day Slovenia and the Vistula River.


4. Defensive Structures and Migrations
Serpent’s Wall: A massive 2,000 km-long fortification in Ukraine, built to defend against Gothic or Hunnic invasions.
Slavic Migration (6th–7th Century):
After the fall of the Byzantine army in 551 AD, Slavs settled in the Balkans, spreading to Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia.
Established autonomous regions called “Slavinia” within the Byzantine Empire.


5. The Founding of Kyiv
Prince Kyi: A Polan prince and military leader who founded Kyiv in the 5th–6th century AD.
Kyiv was strategically located on hills and at the crossroads of major trade routes.
The Three Founders: According to the Primary Chronicle, Kyiv was founded by brothers Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv, and their sister Lybid.


6. Kyiv as a Major Medieval City
Gardariki: The Vikings called Ukraine "Gardariki" (“the realm of cities”) due to its numerous fortified settlements.
Kyiv's Growth: By the 11th century, Kyiv was the second-largest city in Europe after Constantinople, with up to 150,000 residents.


7. Formation of the Ukrainian People
Cultural Fusion:
Indo-Iranian tribes (Scythians, Sarmatians) settled in the steppe.
Proto-Slavic tribes settled in the forests.
These groups intermixed in the forest-steppe zone, forming the foundation of the Ukrainian people.
Homogeneity: The widespread presence of Slavs, Scythians, and Sarmatians across Ukraine led to a relatively homogeneous population.


8. The Role of the Antean Tribal Union
Origins of Ukrainians: Most historians, following Mykhailo Hrushevsky, date the origin of the Ukrainian people to the time of the Antean tribal union (4th–7th century AD).
Cultural Integration: Over time, the Scythians and Sarmatians assimilated into Slavic culture, adopting the Slavic language and traditions.


9. Foreign Influences on Ukrainian Culture
Limited Impact: While Ukraine experienced influences from Turkic, Tatar, Polish, and Russian cultures, these were relatively short-lived.
Established Identity: By the time of these foreign contacts, the Ukrainian people were already formed with distinct cultural, linguistic, and social traits.


Ukraine and Scandinavia - The Viking Connection

1. The Arrival of the Varangians (Vikings) in Eastern Europe
Vikings in Different Regions:
Varangians (Eastern Europe, including Ukraine).
Normans (Western Europe).
Vikings (their self-designation).
Role of the Varangians:
Established dynasties in France, England, Southern Italy, and Slavic lands.
Controlled key trade routes from Scandinavia to Byzantium.


2. The Establishment of Kyiv as the Center of Rus’
862 AD:
Varangians Askold and Dir took control of Kyiv, strengthening its power.
Foreigners noted a strong Slavic principality ruled by King Dir along the Dnipro River.
Kyiv was already powerful before Viking control, even attacking Byzantium.
882 AD:
New Varangian rulers, Prince Ihor (Igor) and Oleg the Prophet, arrived in Kyiv.
Oleg killed Askold and Dir, consolidating Kyivan Rus’.
Declared Kyiv “the mother of Rus’ cities”.
Central Russia only fell under Rus’ control 100 years later.


3. Viking Influence on the Expansion of Kyivan Rus’
Key Conquests:
883-884 AD: Oleg subjugated Slavic tribes (Reptilians, Severians) under Kyiv.
907 AD: Oleg attacked Constantinople, nailed his shield to the gates, and secured a trade treaty with Byzantium.
915 AD: Prince Ihor launched raids on Byzantium and Transcaucasia but was killed by the Drevlians while demanding tribute.
946 AD: Princess Olha (Olga), Ihor’s widow, crushed the Drevlians in revenge.
Burned their city using sparrows and pigeons tied with fire-starting materials.
Established a tribute system (⅔ to Kyiv, ⅓ to Vyshhorod).
957 AD: Olha visited Byzantium and converted to Christianity, laying the foundation for later conversion of Kyivan Rus’.


4. Prince Sviatoslav the Brave (The First Slavic-Named Ruler of Rurik Dynasty)
First Varangian ruler with a Slavic name (evidence of cultural assimilation).
Military Leadership:
Famous Quote: Before attacking, he warned enemies with “I am coming for you”.
Personal Appearance: Described by Byzantine historian Leo the Deacon as resembling a Ukrainian Cossack with:
A long mustache.
A shaven head with a single long lock of hair.
An earring and a white shirt.


5. Expansion of Kyivan Rus’ Under Sviatoslav the Brave
964-966 AD:
Subjugated the Vyatichi tribes (in what is now Central Russia).
Redirected tribute from the Vyatichi to Kyiv instead of the Khazars.
965 AD:
Destroyed the powerful Khazar Khaganate, eliminating a major rival.
Conquered the Khazar capital (Atil) and the fortress of Sarkel, renaming it Bilaya Vezha (White Tower).
Campaigns in the Balkans (970-971 AD):
Initially allied with Byzantium against the Bulgars.
Later turned against Byzantium and launched multiple Balkan campaigns.
Locked the gates behind his troops to ensure no one fled from battle.
However, he was ultimately defeated and forced to retreat.


6. Sviatoslav’s Death and the Aftermath
Betrayal by Byzantium: The Byzantines encouraged Pecheng (nomadic Turkic tribe) attacks on the retreating Rus’.
Sviatoslav was killed in battle.
Legacy:
Established Kyiv’s control over Crimea, previously ruled by the Khazars.
Laid the foundation for Tmutarakan Principality, which remained part of Kyivan Rus’.


7. Lasting Connections Between Ukraine and Scandinavia
Scandinavian rulers integrated into Slavic culture over time.
Slavic language and traditions dominated Kyivan Rus’ despite its Viking origins.
Vikings admired Kyiv, calling it "Gardariki" (Realm of Fortresses).


Conclusion: Viking Influence on Ukraine’s History
Vikings played a crucial role in the early formation of Kyivan Rus’, but the state quickly became Slavic in nature.
Sviatoslav’s victories expanded Kyiv’s power, but his death marked the end of major Viking dominance in Rus’.
Scandinavian influences remain in Ukrainian history, culture, and connections to Northern Europe.


Ukraine and its golden age:

Volodymyr the Great (980–1015): Architect of Ukraine’s Foundations
1. Christianity and Religious Reforms:
Volodymyr introduced Christianity to Ukraine in 988 AD, marking a significant cultural shift.
He personally converted and renounced his 12 official wives and 800 concubines, signaling a break from pagan traditions.
Pagan idols were systematically destroyed; the idol of Perun, the chief god, was dragged through Kiev and thrown into the Dnipro River.
While Christianity was rapidly adopted in Kiev and its surroundings, paganism persisted in other regions. For instance, pagan revolts occurred in Novgorod, and volkhvy (pagan priests) led rebellions in Suzdal even 150 years later.

2. Expansion and Defense:
Volodymyr expanded Kiev's control over large parts of Eastern Europe, including modern Central Russia.
Early in his reign, the Vyatichi refused to pay tribute, but he subdued them by 981 AD, establishing a taxation system that collected from households ("from the plow").
He defeated the Radimichs at the Pishchana River, thanks to his military commander, Vovchy Khvist ("Wolf's Tail").
To protect the state from nomadic incursions, Volodymyr constructed fortified cities along key rivers (Desna, Oster, Trubizh, Sula, and Stuhna).

3. Chersonese Campaign and Byzantine Alliance:
In 988, Volodymyr sent a 6,000-strong force to aid Byzantium in internal conflicts. When the Byzantine emperors failed to honor their promise to marry their sister to him, Volodymyr besieged Chersonese Taurica (modern-day Crimea).
After a nine-month siege, he captured the city by disrupting its water supply, making him the first conqueror of Chersonese in its 1,500-year history.
Volodymyr then exchanged the city for marriage to the Byzantine princess, a union that required his baptism into Christianity.

4. Governance and Social Initiatives:
Volodymyr introduced written law, similar to legal systems in other civilized states, and reduced reliance on Varangian mercenaries.
He emphasized social welfare, distributing alms to the poor and disabled, and prioritized education by sending the children of the nobility to newly established schools.
Volodymyr’s leadership combined military prowess and governance, evidenced by his famous statement: "I shall not find an army with silver and gold, but I shall find silver and gold with an army."
Yaroslav the Wise (1018–1054): The Strategist and Builder

5. Military Achievements and Stability:
Yaroslav solidified his rule in Kiev after defeating rivals and overcoming internal strife, including the treacherous murder of his brothers Borys and Hlib.
He defeated external threats from the Poles, Lithuanians, Yatvingians, and Finns, extending Kiev's influence into modern-day Central Russia.
In 1036, he decisively defeated the Pechenegs near Kiev, ending their long-standing threat. This victory was celebrated with the construction of St. Sophia’s Cathedral.

6. Church Autonomy and Cultural Flourishing:
Yaroslav sought autocephaly (independence) for the Ukrainian Church, facilitating the election of Rusyn Illarion as the first Ukrainian metropolitan in 1051.
He promoted Christianity as a unifying force and supported the construction of churches, monasteries, and schools across Kiev.

7. Urban Development and Fortifications:
Yaroslav transformed Kiev into a fortified city with walls 20 meters high, 30 meters wide at the base, and 3.5 kilometers long.
He expanded the city’s territory, founding "Yaroslav’s City" and strengthening the fortress on Zamkova Hill.
His influence extended beyond Ukraine, with border outposts and cities bearing his name, such as Jarosław (Poland), Yaroslavl (Russia), Yurev (Estonia), and Bila Tserkva (Ukraine). Together, these cities formed a symbolic cross, representing Yaroslav’s blessing over Kiev’s lands.

8. Dynastic Alliances and International Influence:
Yaroslav’s children married into royal families across Europe, creating alliances with Hungary, Norway, Poland, Byzantium, and France.
His daughter, Anna Yaroslavna, married the French king and left a notable legacy. She signed official French documents in Cyrillic, and her letters described France as a "barbaric country" with "gloomy dwellings" and "ugly customs."
Anna’s descendants ruled France until the 14th century, cementing Yaroslav’s influence on European history.
Threats and Challenges During the Golden Age

9. Nomadic Invasions:
Beginning in the 4th–6th centuries AD, Ukraine’s steppe regions faced repeated invasions by Turkic tribes, including the Pechenegs. These nomads sought the fertile lands of Ukraine and attacked the borders of Byzantium and the Slavic states.
The Pechenegs established themselves in the steppes by the late 9th century, posing a major threat to Kiev. Their power waned after Yaroslav’s decisive victory in 1036.

10. Pagan Resistance:
Despite the Christianization efforts of Volodymyr and Yaroslav, pagan practices persisted. Rebellions led by pagan priests occurred in Suzdal, and missionaries like Kuksha of the Kiev Caves were executed by pagan Vyatichi as late as the 1130s.
Legacy of the Golden Age
The Golden Age of Ukraine under Volodymyr the Great and Yaroslav the Wise was a transformative period that defined the cultural, religious, and political identity of the region. Key legacies include:

The adoption and spread of Christianity, which unified the state and connected it to Byzantine culture.
The establishment of Kiev as a major center of governance, religion, and learning.
Territorial expansion and the development of a robust legal system.
Strong international alliances through dynastic marriages, which integrated Ukraine into European political and cultural networks.
Urban development and infrastructure, with Kiev emerging as a fortified and prosperous capital.
This era not only strengthened Kiev’s dominance in Eastern Europe but also laid the foundation for Ukraine’s enduring historical and cultural identity.
