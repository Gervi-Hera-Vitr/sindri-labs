= Chapter 1: Basics of Physics
(Introduction to Physics)

== 1.1 What is Physics?
Physics is the study of matter, energy, and how they interact.

It explains the fundamental laws of nature that govern motion, forces, energy, and the structure of matter.

It answers:
* Why things move
* How energy is transferred
* How the universe works at every scale

== 1.2 Why Study Physics?
Physics is the foundation of other sciences like chemistry, biology, and astronomy.

It helps in developing technology, from smartphones to rockets.

It improves problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

== 1.3 Branches of Physics
* *Mechanics*: Motion, forces, energy (Newton's Laws)
* *Thermodynamics*: Heat, temperature, and energy transfer
* *Waves and Sound*: Vibrations, sound, and wave behavior
* *Optics*: Light, lenses, mirrors, reflection/refraction
* *Electricity and Magnetism*: Circuits, electric fields, magnets
* *Modern Physics*: Quantum physics, relativity, atomic theory

== 1.4 Scientific Method in Physics
Physics relies on the scientific method, which includes:

. Observation
. Question
. Hypothesis
. Experiment
. Data Collection
. Analysis
. Conclusion

== 1.5 Physical Quantities and Units
Physics uses measurements to describe and predict phenomena.

_Base Quantities_:
* Length - meters (m)
* Mass - kilograms (kg)
* Time - seconds (s)
* Temperature - kelvin (K)
* Electric current - amperes (A)

== 1.6 SI Units (International System of Units)
The SI system is the standard for measurements.

*Example*:
* Distance = meters (m)
* Mass = kilograms (kg)
* Time = seconds (s)
* Force = newtons (N) (Derived unit)

== 1.7 Scalars vs. Vectors
* *Scalar*: Quantity with magnitude only (size)
_Example_: Speed = 60 km/h
* *Vector*: Quantity with magnitude and direction
_Example_: Velocity = 60 km/h north

== 1.8 Measurement and Instruments
* Length → Ruler, Vernier Caliper, Micrometer
* Mass → Balance
* Time → Stopwatch
* Temperature → Thermometer
* Electric Current → Ammeter

== 1.9 Accuracy, Precision, and Errors
* *Accuracy*: How close a measurement is to the true value.
* *Precision*: How consistent repeated measurements are.

_Error types_:
* Systematic error: Consistent, repeatable error.
* Random error: Unpredictable variations in measurements.

== 1.10 Graphs and Data Representation
* *Line Graphs*: Show changes over time or relationships.
* *Bar Graphs*: Compare quantities.
* *Pie Charts*: Show parts of a whole.

== 1.11 Basic Mathematical Skills for Physics
* Algebra (solving equations)
* Ratios and Proportions
* Graphs and Slopes (understanding relationships)
* Trigonometry (basic sine, cosine, tangent)
