This guide provides a structured approach to collecting, organizing, and managing business contacts efficiently using Google Workspace.

== 1. Collecting Business Contacts
To create a robust contact list, use the following sources:
Emails: Review inboxes for past business communications.
LinkedIn: Export connections and look for industry-relevant contacts.
Freelance Platforms: Upwork, Fiverr, and Toptal contain valuable contacts.
Job Boards: Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn Jobs often list hiring managers.
Networking Events: Gather contacts from industry conferences, webinars, and meetups.
Old Resumes & Business Cards: Reconnect with past colleagues and employers.
Recruiters & Agencies: Identify professionals in hiring and talent acquisition.

=== Ensure Each Contact Includes:

Full Name

Company Name

Industry

Email Address

Phone Number (if available)

Job Title

Service Type (Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Freelance, Networking, etc.)

Last Contacted Date

Status: (New Lead, Contacted, Pending Follow-up, Interview Scheduled)

== 2. Create a Google Spreadsheet to Store Contacts

Open Google Sheets and create a new document.

Useful stuff for GueGoa:

- https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/build-a-basic-table/[Build a Basic Table] and down from there -- title on the left;
- https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[Asciidoctor Writer's Guide] -- the whole shebang on use.

// And you can also comment out like this...  Ctlr + /

Set up the following column headers:

[cols="^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^", options="header"]
|===
| Contact Name
| Company
| Industry
| Email
| Phone
| Job Title
| Service Type
| Priority (High, Medium, Low)
| Status

| a
| b
| c
| d
| e
| f
| g
| h
| i

|===

Use drop-down lists in the "Service Type," "Priority," and "Status" columns for easy data entry (Data Validation in Google Sheets).

Apply conditional formatting to highlight high-priority contacts.

Save the spreadsheet in Google Drive for cloud backup and real-time collaboration.

== 3. Import Contacts into Google Contacts for Easy Management

Open Google Contacts.

Click "Import" on the left menu.

Select Google CSV as the file format.

Upload the Google Spreadsheet CSV file.

Click Import and review the contacts for accuracy.

Use the "Find Duplicates" function to merge duplicate contacts.

== 4. Categorize Contacts with Labels in Google Contacts

Open Google Contacts and select the imported contacts.

Click “Create label” in the left sidebar.

Name labels by category (e.g., Recruiters, Tech Companies, Networking, Freelance Work).

Assign contacts to relevant labels for quick filtering.

Use the Search Bar to find contacts based on label, company, or priority.

== 5. Enable Google Workspace Directory for Shared Access
For Google Workspace Admins:

Open Google Admin Console.

Navigate to "Apps" → "Google Workspace" → "Directory".

Click "Sharing settings" and enable “Contact sharing”.

Set access levels:

Everyone in the organization (for company-wide access)

Specific Groups (for team-specific access)

Click Save to apply the settings.

Users can now access shared contacts under "Directory" in Google Contacts.

== 6. Share & Manage Contacts Across Accounts
=== Option 1: Share Manually (CSV Export & Import)

Open Google Contacts.

Select the contacts to share.

Click "Export" and choose Google CSV.

Send the CSV file via email, Google Drive, or another platform.

The recipient imports the contacts using Step 3.

=== Option 2: Use Google Workspace Directory (Best for Teams)

Allows real-time access to contacts within the organization.

Contacts update automatically without manual re-sharing.

=== Option 3: Use Third-Party Contact Sharing Apps (For External Sharing)

Shared Contacts for Gmail

Contacts+

Google Workspace Contact Manager

These apps enable real-time contact sharing outside Google Workspace.

== 7. Automating and Maintaining Contacts

Enable Google Sheets Notifications:

Set up automatic reminders for team members to update contacts.

Use Google Apps Script for Contact Syncing:

Automate syncing between Google Sheets and Google Contacts.

Review Contacts Monthly:

Archive inactive contacts.

Update statuses (e.g., "Follow-Up Needed" or "Closed Lead").

Check for Duplicate Entries:

Use Google Contacts' built-in duplicate detection.

Backup Regularly:

Store backups of contact data in a separate Google Sheet.

== 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues
=== Problem: Import Errors in Google Contacts

Ensure the CSV file matches Google's required format.

Check for missing or corrupted fields.

=== Problem: Contacts Not Syncing in Google Workspace Directory

Verify that the Directory Sharing setting is enabled in Google Admin Console.

Check if the user has the correct permissions to view shared contacts.

=== Problem: Duplicate Contacts

Use the "Merge & Fix" tool in Google Contacts to resolve duplicates.
