Review of the introduction to the little red book of selling

The very first lesson we learn is that if a customer likes you,
they believe in you, trust you, and then they MIGHT buy from you.

More importantly they dont like to be sold, but they love to buy!

Between learning how to sell and, why do people buy. learning why people buy is 10000x more important.
Many think they know why customers buy but in reality they dont.
This is proven when they:
1. price objections
2. they have to send bids or proposals
3. when there customers claim to be satisfied with there present supplier
4. No one is returning there calls.
4.5. There complaining the economy is slow.

Here is the truth:
1. people buy because, most powerfully they LIKE there sales rep. They like them and from that they have TRUST.
2. they understand what there buying
3. they see the difference between the person and the company there buying from
4.they know the value of the product there purchasing
5.they have faith in there sales rep.
6.they have confidence in there sales rep.
7.they have trust in there sales rep.
8.there comfortable in there sales rep.
9.They feel there needs are satisfied by the product or service.
10.the price seems fair
11.the product or service will increase there productivity

The best way to understand your customers:

invite them to a seminar on how to build THERE business
offer great luxury and food
tell them there are also gonna be 15-20 minutes worth of questions on how to strengthen there relationship
craft some questions about how you meet their needs for what there looking for in a vendor/partner
