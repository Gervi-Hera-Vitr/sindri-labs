I am writing this essay to show what I learned this semester. +

 (@rdd13r - point taken for skimping on the essay description.)

== ML: Decision Trees

I learned about decision trees and what they do.
And I made a masterclass to reflect on this.

. link:../../../labs/Google/Decision-Trees-Full-Course/Decision-Trees.ipynb[Decision Trees Notebook] - understanding Decisions Trees: grade A+ (@rdd13r).
. link:../../../labs/Google/Decision-Trees-Full-Course/Decision-Trees-Two.ipynb[Decision Trees Notebook (Experimentation)] - experimenting classifiers and Decisions Trees: grade A (@rdd13r).
. link:../../../labs/Google/Decision-Trees-Full-Course/Decision-Trees-Three.ipynb[Decision Trees Notebook (Bonus Work)] - completely bonus work grade A+ (@rdd13r).

I used the https://archive.ics.uci.edu/[UCI Machine Learning Repository] for this project.

 (@rdd13r - 1 bonus point given on experimentation (part two) and and 2 points on presentation (part three))

Next, I learned about *_Statistics and Probability_* for *Machine Learning*.
I used the following courses for these:

* https://www.khanacademy.org[Khan Academy], see curriculum for topics (teacher-provided);
* Two (2) courses from Derek Banas:

** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcusIOfI_GM&t=1ss[Statistics].

Last but not least, I learned about the Stock market and how to make money from it.
Key concepts that I discovered and learned are:

== Classes Missed or not Attempted

Some Classes I missed though this semester are:

. History, although I really wanted to continue my learning trails in Europe;
. Science, especially the Introduction to Physics that was moved down;
. And American Literature, because we're waiting on the right textbooks.

These can be made up in the future.


== My Wishlist for the Next Semester

As for next semester, I plan on Learning:

. Business and Economics;
. Expanding Python;
. Science and History of computers;
. Mathematics of Algebra;
. Continuation of ML.

== Final Grade

* (3) three points taken for the sloppy summary;
* (4) four points granted for independent research and depth.

#A+ grade.#
