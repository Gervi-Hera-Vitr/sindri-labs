M√≠mir Academy operates on a one-week unit of instruction.
Each week follows a specified and standardized format.
There are three different day categories.
Each category is paired in two days.
Each day consists of 2 (two) class pairs each 90 minutes long.
Class pairs have a primary 90-minute session which covers theory.
