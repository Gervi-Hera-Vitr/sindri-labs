M√≠mir Academy operates on a one-week unit of instruction.
Each week follows a specified and standardized format.
We follow a 2 subject week were I learn 2 subjects that
are in the same category(Exp: coding and math in Stem).
At the end of the week I need to show what I learned in a Project.


Learning categories are as follows:

- Stem(Science, math, engineering, tech.)
- Humanities(english, philosophy, writing, psychology)
