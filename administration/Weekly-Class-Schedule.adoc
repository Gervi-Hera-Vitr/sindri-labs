M√≠mir Academy operates on a one-week unit of instruction.
Each week follows a specified and standardized format.
There are three different day categories.
Each category is paired in two days.
Each day consists of 2 (two) class pairs each 90 minutes long.
Class pairs have a primary 90-minute session which covers theory.
And a supporting 90-minute session that applies theory *_hands-on_*.
It is the hands-on section graded on each block of instruction.

Learning categories are as follows:

. Hard Skills - math, reading, language arts, science;
. Soft Skills - social, physical, and personal development;
. Connecting skills - physical asset building with active learning.
